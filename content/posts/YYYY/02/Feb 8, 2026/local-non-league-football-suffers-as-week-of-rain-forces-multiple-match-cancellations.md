A week of relentless rain has wreaked havoc on the local non-league football calendar, leading to multiple cancellations across Sussex. Matches scheduled in the Isthmian south east division included Eastbourne Town's home game against Merstham and Hassocks' fixture versus Faversham, both of which were postponed due to adverse weather conditions. Additionally, Broadbridge Heath vs Whyteleafe, Crowborough v Ashford United, and Hastings v Three Bridges were also called off. In the Isthmian south central division, Littlehampton’s match against Raynes Park Vale suffered a similar fate. The continued rain has put a significant strain on local clubs, affecting not only their schedules but also fan engagement and revenue. Local football enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting clearer skies to resume play.
