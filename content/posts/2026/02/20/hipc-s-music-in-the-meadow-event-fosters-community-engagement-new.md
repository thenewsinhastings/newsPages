The Hastings and Rother Independent Producers Club (HIPC) has announced its upcoming 'Music in the Meadow' event, scheduled to take place on Saturday, June 17th. This initiative is part of HIPC's broader outreach programme aimed at bringing together local artists, musicians, and community members for a day filled with entertainment and engagement.

The event will be held in the picturesque grounds of Stade Green Meadows, Hastings, offering a perfect backdrop for music performances by local bands and soloists. Attendees can look forward to enjoying live music, food stalls, and family-friendly activities that celebrate the vibrant cultural scene of Hastings and Rye.

HIPC's outreach programme seeks not only to entertain but also to support local artists and musicians in showcasing their talents to a wider audience. By organising events such as 'Music in the Meadow', HIPC aims to strengthen community ties and promote the rich diversity of artistic expression within the area.

Residents are encouraged to join this free event, which promises to be an enjoyable way to spend the afternoon while supporting local arts and culture.
