The Hastings Borough Council has given the green light to a new recycling initiative aimed at boosting environmental sustainability within Hastings and Rye. The program includes an expansion of curbside collection services, additional drop-off points for hard-to-recycle materials, and public awareness campaigns to educate residents on best practices.

Councillor Jane Green, who presented the proposal during the council meeting, emphasized the importance of reducing waste and promoting recycling in the face of increasing environmental concerns. 'Our goal is not only to comply with national regulations but also to lead by example,' she stated.

The initiative will be funded through a combination of local government grants and partnerships with private sector sponsors interested in corporate social responsibility. Residents can expect more detailed information about how they can participate in the program over the coming weeks.
