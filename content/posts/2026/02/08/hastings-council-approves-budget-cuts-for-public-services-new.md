In a meeting held last night at Hastings Town Hall, the council approved a series of budget cuts aimed at addressing the financial challenges faced by the borough. The decision follows months of deliberation and consultations with local residents and stakeholders.

The proposed cuts will affect several departments including education, community safety, and environmental services. Council members expressed their concerns about the potential impact on the most vulnerable members of the community but emphasized that these measures are necessary to ensure long-term financial stability for Hastings.

James Ryder, Political Editor, notes that while the council has assured residents that every effort will be made to minimize disruption, many local businesses and organizations have raised objections. The budget cuts come as part of a wider strategy to reduce public expenditure across East Sussex and are expected to face scrutiny in upcoming elections.
