The Hastings & Rye Borough Council is set to deliberate on a new set of measures aimed at safeguarding coastal communities from the escalating threat of rising sea levels. This proposal comes in response to increasing concerns raised by local residents and environmental groups about the vulnerability of low-lying areas along the coast.

At a recent council meeting, Councillor Jane Thompson presented data indicating that without intervention, several key areas of Hastings could face severe flooding risks within the next decade. The proposed measures include the construction of new sea walls, enhancement of existing drainage systems, and the establishment of a coastal resilience fund to support future maintenance needs.

Public consultations are scheduled for early April, with the council inviting residents and stakeholders to provide feedback on these proposals. Environmental groups have welcomed the initiative but stressed the importance of incorporating green solutions that enhance biodiversity alongside protection efforts.

For local communities, this decision could not be more critical. Many homes and businesses in Rye stand to benefit from such measures, given their proximity to the coast. The council's approach will also influence wider discussions on regional coastal management strategies moving forward.
