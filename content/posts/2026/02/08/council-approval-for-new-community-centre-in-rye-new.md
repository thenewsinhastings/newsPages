The local council has given the green light to construct a new community centre in Rye, aimed at fostering social cohesion and providing essential services for the area's residents. The proposed centre will include amenities such as a library, meeting rooms, and a café space that will be accessible to all members of the community.

Council members discussed the project during their recent meeting, highlighting its importance for future-proofing Rye’s infrastructure in response to growing population demands. The new facility is expected to play a key role in supporting local initiatives and enhancing quality of life for residents.

While the council has secured initial funding, additional support from local businesses and community groups will be crucial for the project's success. Residents are encouraged to attend upcoming consultations to provide feedback on the centre’s design and features.
