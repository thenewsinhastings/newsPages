The Town Council of Hastings and Rye has given the green light to a new affordable housing scheme designed to address the growing need for low-cost homes in both towns. The project, which aims to provide over 100 units across several developments, will focus on delivering quality living spaces that are accessible to key workers and young families.

Councillor Emma Green, the lead spokesperson for the Affordable Housing Initiative, said, “This decision marks a significant step forward in our commitment to ensuring that residents from all walks of life can find homes they can afford within their communities. We have worked closely with local developers and housing associations to ensure that these new units will meet both current needs and future demands.”

The scheme is expected to create around 50 construction jobs over the next two years, providing a boost to the local economy as well as addressing the housing crisis. Community groups and residents have shown widespread support for the initiative, seeing it as vital for maintaining the social fabric of Hastings and Rye.

Opposition councillors welcomed the plans but expressed concerns about ensuring long-term sustainability and integration within existing neighbourhoods. They called for ongoing monitoring to prevent potential issues such as overcrowding or displacement of current residents.

As construction begins in early 2024, local authorities will continue to work closely with stakeholders to ensure that these new developments contribute positively to the community’s growth and well-being.
