A local charity based in Hastings has launched a new fundraising campaign aimed at supporting various community projects within the region. The initiative aims to raise funds for essential services and activities that benefit both residents of Hastings and those living in Rye.

The charity, which focuses on improving quality of life through community engagement, announced its plans during a press conference held at the town hall this week. Representatives from the organization highlighted several projects that have already been approved and are set to receive funding once the target amount is reached.

Among the proposed projects are improvements to local parks, support for elderly care programs, and educational initiatives aimed at youth development. The charity encourages residents and businesses alike to contribute to the cause by participating in upcoming fundraising events or making direct donations.

For more information about the fundraiser and how you can get involved, please visit the charity's official website or contact them directly via their provided hotline number.
