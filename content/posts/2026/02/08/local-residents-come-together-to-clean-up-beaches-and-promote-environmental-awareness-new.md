Residents of Hastings and Rye recently joined forces in a community-led initiative to clean up local beaches and promote environmental awareness. The event, organized by the Hastings Beach Clean-Up Group, attracted over 100 volunteers who collected hundreds of kilograms of litter from the coastline.

The cleanup effort not only aimed at beautifying the area but also served as an educational platform for participants to learn about marine conservation and the impact of plastic waste on sea life. Local schools were involved in this project through a poster competition, where students created designs emphasizing the importance of preserving our natural environment.

Councillor Jane Smith, speaking at the event, praised the efforts of volunteers and highlighted the need for continued collaboration between community groups, local authorities, and residents to tackle environmental issues collectively. She encouraged everyone to maintain these practices beyond one-day events, fostering a sustainable culture that respects the marine ecosystem.
