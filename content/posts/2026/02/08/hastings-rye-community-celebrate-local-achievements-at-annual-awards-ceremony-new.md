The annual Hastings and Rye Community Awards ceremony was held last night in the town hall, celebrating outstanding achievements by local residents. Over 200 people attended the event to honour individuals who have made significant contributions to their communities.

Award categories included Volunteer of the Year, Youth Achiever of the Year, and Unsung Hero. The evening was a testament to the strong sense of community spirit in Hastings and Rye, with winners coming from various backgrounds and age groups.

Among the recipients was Lisa Thompson, who won the Community Champion Award for her work supporting local families through challenging times. 'I feel incredibly honoured,' said Ms. Thompson. 'It's all about making a difference in people’s lives.'

The event also featured speeches by local councillors highlighting the importance of community engagement and volunteerism.
