The Seaview Project and the Energy Services Company (ESC)’s Retrofit Advice Service have received high praise from local residents, with many expressing gratitude for the support and guidance they’ve been offered. The initiative aims to improve energy efficiency in homes across Hastings and Rye, reducing carbon emissions while also making properties more comfortable and affordable to heat.

The service offers free advice sessions where homeowners can discuss potential improvements such as insulation, double glazing, and renewable technologies like solar panels or air source heat pumps. Participants have reported feeling empowered by the knowledge they’ve gained about how to make their homes greener and less expensive to run in the long term.

'The Retrofit Advice Service has been a game-changer for us,' said one resident who requested anonymity. 'After our session, we’re now looking into installing solar panels which will not only help the environment but also cut down on our electricity bills significantly.'

The Seaview Project, in collaboration with ESC and Hastings Council, plans to continue its outreach efforts across the community over the coming months. Workshops are scheduled for both homeowners and landlords who wish to learn more about retrofitting their properties.

For those interested in taking part, further information is available on the project’s website or by contacting the ESC directly.
