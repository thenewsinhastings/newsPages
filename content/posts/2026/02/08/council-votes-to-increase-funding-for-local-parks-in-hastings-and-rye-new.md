The Hastings Borough Council has approved an increase in funding for local parks, aiming to enhance facilities and improve maintenance across the area. The decision was made during a council meeting on Wednesday, with councillors unanimously supporting the initiative.

The proposal includes additional resources for playground equipment replacement, installation of new fitness stations, and increased staffing levels for park attendants. Councilor Sarah Green, who championed the motion, stated that 'the health and well-being of our residents are paramount, and providing better recreational spaces is a key component.'

Local groups such as the Hastings Parks Alliance have welcomed the news, seeing it as a significant step towards fostering community engagement and active lifestyles. Residents can look forward to improved amenities in popular parks like Alexandra Park and Rock-a-Nore Gardens.

The funding will be allocated over the next fiscal year, with detailed plans for implementation set to be discussed at future council meetings.
