The Hastings Borough Council has approved a significant increase in funding for local parks and recreation facilities, allocating an additional £250,000 to improve amenities across the borough. The decision comes after months of consultation with community groups and residents who have highlighted the need for better maintenance and facilities at popular spots such as Alexandra Park and Rock-a-Nore Road Gardens.

Councillor Jane Smith, leader of the council's parks committee, said: 'This investment will not only enhance the quality of life for local families but also support our efforts to attract more visitors to Hastings. With these funds, we aim to provide better playground equipment, extend walking paths, and install new sports facilities.'

The move has been welcomed by local businesses and tourism groups who see it as a positive step towards boosting economic activity in the area. However, some councillors have raised concerns about potential budget constraints affecting other essential services.

Mayor of Hastings, Councillor John Williams, reassured residents that while parks are an important aspect of community well-being, all areas of municipal responsibility will continue to receive necessary support.
