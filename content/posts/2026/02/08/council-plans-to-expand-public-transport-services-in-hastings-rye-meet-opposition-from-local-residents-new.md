The Hastings and Rye Borough Council has proposed a plan to enhance public transport services within the region, aiming to improve connectivity and reduce traffic congestion. The initiative includes the introduction of additional bus routes and increased frequencies on existing lines.

However, the proposal has faced opposition from local residents who are concerned about the potential impact on road safety and parking availability. Some argue that while the initiative is well-intentioned, it may exacerbate issues such as noise pollution and congestion during peak hours.

Councillor Jane Thompson, spokesperson for the council's transport committee, stated: 'Our goal is to provide a more sustainable public transport system that benefits all residents. We have engaged with local community groups and taken their feedback into consideration when drafting this proposal.'

The council will hold a series of public consultations throughout May to gather further input from residents before finalizing the plans.

For those interested in participating, the first consultation meeting is scheduled for May 5th at Rye Town Hall.
