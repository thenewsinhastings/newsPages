The month-long celebration of heritage in Hastings and Rye has kicked off with an array of events designed to showcase the rich history and cultural diversity of the area. Local residents and visitors alike are encouraged to participate in a series of activities, including guided historical walks, exhibitions at the local museum, and storytelling sessions that highlight the unique stories and traditions of our community.

Organisers have also planned a special event on Heritage Day where the Hastings Town Hall will open its doors for a free heritage fair, featuring live music, crafts from local artisans, and interactive displays. The aim is to educate both young and old about the significance of preserving cultural heritage in today’s rapidly changing world.

Councillor Jane Smith, spokesperson for the Heritage Committee, said: 'Heritage Month offers an excellent opportunity for us to come together as a community and celebrate our shared history. It’s also a chance to reflect on how we can continue to protect and enhance our local heritage sites.' She added that this year's focus will be on engaging younger generations through interactive workshops and online resources.

For more information about the events scheduled throughout Heritage Month, residents are invited to visit the official website or contact their local library for a full schedule. This month promises to be an exciting time as Hastings and Rye bring their heritage alive.
