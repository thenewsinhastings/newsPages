The Hastings Borough Council will hold a crucial meeting next week to discuss the future of Hastings Pier, a historic landmark and tourist attraction. The pier has faced significant challenges in recent years, including structural issues that necessitate substantial investment.

Councillors are set to review proposals from various stakeholders aimed at revitalizing the pier while ensuring its long-term sustainability. Local businesses and residents have expressed strong interest in seeing the pier restored to its former glory as it plays a pivotal role in Hastings' economy and cultural identity.

The council’s decision is expected to impact local tourism significantly, with potential implications for other coastal towns such as Rye, which also relies on historical landmarks to attract visitors. Community members are encouraged to attend the meeting or submit their views ahead of time to contribute to this important discussion.
