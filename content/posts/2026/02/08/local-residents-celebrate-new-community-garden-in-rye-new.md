Residents of Rye gathered at the newly established community garden to celebrate its opening, marking a significant addition to local green spaces. The garden, located on Market Street, features raised beds for vegetable gardening, an area dedicated to wildflowers, and ample seating for social gatherings. Local volunteers have been instrumental in transforming the space over several months.

Councillor Jane Cooper, speaking at the event, praised the efforts of community members and expressed hope that the garden would not only serve as a recreational spot but also educate younger generations about sustainable gardening practices. 'This is more than just a pretty garden,' she said. 'It’s an opportunity for our community to come together and learn from each other.'

The project has received funding from both Rye Town Council and the Hastings & St. Leonard's Borough Council, highlighting the collaboration between local authorities to improve public amenities. Over 50 residents turned out on Saturday afternoon to plant seeds and enjoy refreshments provided by local businesses.

With summer approaching, organisers look forward to a busy season ahead, including workshops on composting, beekeeping, and gardening tips for beginners. For more information about upcoming events or how you can get involved, contact the Rye Community Garden team via their website.
