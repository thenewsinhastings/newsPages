The Hastings & Rye Minister has commissioned an investigation into a group of journalists who were probing the activities of a Labour thinktank, according to sources close to the matter. The thinktank was reportedly led by Josh Simons when he served as its director and is known for supporting Keir Starmer's leadership within the party.

The decision to launch this inquiry has raised eyebrows in local political circles, with some questioning whether it is an attempt to intimidate investigative journalists or scrutinise legitimate reporting. Local Labour Party members have expressed concern that such actions could undermine press freedom and the ability of reporters to hold those in power accountable.

In Hastings and Rye, where community engagement with politics remains high, this development has sparked discussions about transparency and accountability in local government and party operations. The impact on local journalism is also a point of significant interest as it may affect future investigative reporting efforts within the region.
