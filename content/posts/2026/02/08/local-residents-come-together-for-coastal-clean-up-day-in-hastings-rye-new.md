Residents and volunteers from Hastings and Rye gathered on Saturday for the annual Coastal Clean-Up Day, showing their commitment to preserving the local coastline. Over 200 people participated in this year's event, collecting more than 15 bags of litter along the beach areas between Rock-a-Nore and Camber Sands.

Organized by the Hastings & Rye Environmental Task Force, the clean-up is a yearly tradition aimed at raising awareness about marine pollution and encouraging community involvement. In addition to picking up trash, participants also engaged in educational workshops led by local conservation groups.

Councillor Jane Thompson, who oversees environmental initiatives for the borough, praised the efforts of volunteers: 'It's heartening to see such strong community spirit when it comes to protecting our environment. Every piece of litter picked up makes a difference.'

The event not only beautified public spaces but also fostered a sense of ownership among residents over their coastal areas.
