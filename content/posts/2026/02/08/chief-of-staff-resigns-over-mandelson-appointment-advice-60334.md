In a significant development in Westminster, Morgan McSweeney has tendered his resignation as Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister following criticism over advice provided regarding the appointment of Lord Mandelson. This move is likely to have reverberations within the political landscape of Hastings and Rye, where local MPs will be closely monitoring the fallout from this high-profile cabinet reshuffle.

McSweeney has acknowledged his responsibility for the controversial recommendation, stating in a public statement that he stands by his advice but understands its negative implications on the government's reputation. Local political observers suggest that this resignation could pave the way for further changes within the current administration, potentially affecting local policy initiatives and funding allocations.

Residents of Hastings and Rye are encouraged to stay informed as the situation develops, with the potential for local politicians to offer statements regarding the wider implications for their constituencies.
