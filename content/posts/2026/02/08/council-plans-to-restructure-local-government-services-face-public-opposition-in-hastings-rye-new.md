In a move that has sparked public debate and concern among residents, the local council is proposing significant changes to the structure of government services in Hastings and Rye. The proposed reorganisation aims to streamline operations and potentially save millions of pounds but has raised questions about its impact on community services and job security.

According to the council's official statement, the restructuring will involve consolidating several smaller departments into larger units with a focus on improving efficiency and reducing costs. However, critics argue that such changes could lead to a loss of local flavour in decision-making processes, potentially making it harder for residents to engage with their representatives.

Community meetings have already been scheduled across both towns to allow citizens to voice their opinions and concerns about the proposed reforms. The council is urging all interested parties to participate actively in these sessions, which will provide valuable feedback for future policy decisions.

As discussions continue, local politicians are calling for a balanced approach that prioritises both financial prudence and community welfare. Residents who wish to contribute their views on the matter can find details of upcoming consultations online or at their nearest town hall.
