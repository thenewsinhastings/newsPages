The towns of Hastings and Rye are set to benefit from a new community garden project aimed at enhancing local green spaces and promoting environmental awareness. Spearheaded by the Hastings and Rye Community Council, the initiative seeks to transform vacant lots into vibrant public gardens that will serve as communal gathering spots for residents.

Scheduled to begin this spring, volunteers from both towns have already begun planning sessions to select planting schemes and design elements suitable for each site. The project aims not only to beautify neglected areas but also to provide educational opportunities for children and adults alike about sustainable gardening practices.

Council members emphasized the importance of such projects in fostering a sense of community ownership and responsibility towards local greenery. They hope that the initiative will inspire further collaborative efforts between residents, schools, and businesses in maintaining and expanding these green spaces throughout Hastings and Rye.
