The Hastings Borough Council is set to hold a crucial debate on new zoning regulations aimed at managing coastal development. The proposed changes are intended to balance economic growth with environmental protection and the needs of local residents.

According to council documents, the new rules would impose stricter guidelines for construction near the coast to mitigate risks associated with rising sea levels and increased storm activity. This move follows recent discussions on sustainability and resilience in the face of climate change.

Residents and business owners alike have expressed mixed views about the proposed regulations. Some see it as a necessary step towards preserving the town's unique character, while others are concerned that the restrictions could stifle economic opportunities and hinder much-needed infrastructure improvements.

The council meeting is scheduled to take place next week at the Town Hall, with public consultation sessions planned in advance to gather further feedback from the community. The outcome of these discussions will be pivotal for shaping the future development landscape along Hastings' coastline.
