On a sunny morning last Saturday, residents of Hastings and Rye joined forces for the annual Coastal Clean-Up Day. Organised by local environmental groups and supported by the Hastings Borough Council and Rother District Council, this event aims to raise awareness about marine conservation and encourage community involvement in protecting coastal areas.

Volunteers gathered at various locations along the coastline with trash bags, gloves, and litter pickers, covering stretches of beach from Pett Level to Camber Sands. Over 200 participants collected more than half a tonne of debris, including plastic bottles, fishing nets, and cigarette butts, significantly reducing pollution in these areas.

Local environmental groups praised the efforts of the community, emphasising that collective action is crucial for maintaining clean beaches and protecting marine life. The event also featured interactive stalls with educational materials about recycling, waste reduction, and local wildlife conservation.

Councillor Michael Green from Hastings Borough Council highlighted the positive impact of such initiatives on both environmental health and tourism: 'This annual effort not only beautifies our coastlines but also boosts our local economy by attracting visitors who value a clean and sustainable environment.'

As the event concluded, organisers called for ongoing support through regular beach cleans and participation in upcoming conservation projects. They encouraged residents to report any concerns about marine pollution or wildlife health using the dedicated hotline number provided.

For those interested in getting involved, future volunteer opportunities can be found on the local environmental group's website.
