Residents of Rye have come together in a show of community spirit by participating in a beach clean-up initiative along the town's often-overlooked coastal areas. Organised by local environmental group, 'Friends of Rye Coast', the event aimed to raise awareness about marine litter and its impact on wildlife.

Over 50 volunteers turned out for Saturday’s efforts, collecting hundreds of pounds of debris from the shoreline that would otherwise remain a threat to sea life and coastal habitats. The initiative highlights the ongoing need for local action in environmental conservation, which often goes beyond what national policies can address specifically for Rye's unique coastline.

Sarah Bennett, a volunteer and resident of Rye since childhood, commented on the importance of such efforts: 'It’s heartening to see so many people from our community step up. Every bit helps, especially with litter that could harm marine animals or pollute the water.'

The event organisers are planning regular clean-up days throughout the year and encourage more residents to get involved in keeping Rye's beaches pristine for both human enjoyment and ecological health.

For anyone interested in joining future events, further details can be found on 'Friends of Rye Coast’s' Facebook page or by contacting them directly.
