The Hastings and Rye Borough Council has approved a significant budget allocation towards the implementation of its Coastal Protection Programme, aimed at safeguarding the coastal communities from rising sea levels and increased storm activity. The programme includes a series of measures such as the construction of new sea walls, reinforcement of existing defenses, and the installation of flood barriers.

Councillor David Thompson, leader of the council's environment committee, stated, “This investment is crucial for the long-term sustainability of our coastal towns. We are committed to ensuring that residents and businesses are protected against the growing threats posed by climate change.”

The budget will also fund a comprehensive study to assess the environmental impact of these measures and explore additional sustainable solutions for coastal management in Hastings and Rye.

Local residents have expressed their support, particularly given recent severe weather events which highlighted the vulnerability of local properties. However, concerns remain about the long-term financial implications and the need for ongoing maintenance.

Further updates on the progress of the Coastal Protection Programme will be provided by the council as work begins over the coming months.
