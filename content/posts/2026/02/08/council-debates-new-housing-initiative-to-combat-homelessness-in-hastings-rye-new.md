The Hastings and Rye Council is set to debate a new initiative aimed at providing affordable housing solutions for the growing homeless population within the borough. The proposal, which includes plans to convert unused commercial properties into temporary shelters and secure long-term rental agreements with local landlords, seeks to address the urgent need for stable housing amid rising costs.

According to council sources, discussions will also focus on establishing a dedicated fund to support those transitioning from homelessness back into permanent accommodation. Advocates of the initiative highlight its potential to offer immediate relief alongside longer-term solutions.

Local community leaders have expressed their support for the proposal, noting the critical impact it could have in stabilizing the lives of individuals struggling with housing insecurity. However, some council members have raised concerns about the feasibility and long-term sustainability of such measures without broader government intervention.

The public consultation period is expected to begin next month, allowing residents to contribute their thoughts on the proposed initiatives. The council will then review all feedback before proceeding with a final vote later in the year.
