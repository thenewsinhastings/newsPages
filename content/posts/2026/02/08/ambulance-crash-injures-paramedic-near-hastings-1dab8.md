An ambulance carrying a patient to the hospital was involved in a multi-vehicle crash on the A273 near Pyecombe, resulting in injuries to one of the paramedics onboard. The incident occurred late this afternoon and is currently under investigation by local emergency services.

According to initial reports from witnesses, traffic conditions on the A273 were challenging at the time of the accident due to heavy congestion caused by ongoing roadworks near the Pyecombe area. Local emergency response teams immediately deployed additional support to assist with the scene management and patient transport coordination.

The Hastings & Rye community has been reminded to exercise caution while driving on this section of the A273, particularly in light of existing roadwork conditions which may exacerbate traffic congestion and increase risk factors for vehicular accidents.
