The Hastings & Rye Council has given the green light to a new project aimed at enhancing the coastal pathway that runs between both towns. The initiative, which includes widening paths and installing additional lighting for safety purposes, is expected to boost tourism and improve local residents' quality of life.

Councillor Sarah Thompson, leader of the council’s infrastructure committee, stated: 'This project represents a significant investment in our community's wellbeing and economic prosperity. We are committed to ensuring that Hastings & Rye remain accessible and enjoyable for both visitors and locals.' The project is set to begin construction in early spring and will take approximately six months to complete.

Residents have generally welcomed the news, with many expressing appreciation for improved accessibility along the coastline. However, some concerns have been raised about potential disruptions during the construction period. Local business owners are encouraged to engage with the council’s liaison team to discuss any specific needs or challenges they might face during this time.
