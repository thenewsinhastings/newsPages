The Hastings Borough Council has approved its budget for the upcoming year, marking a significant milestone in local governance. The decision was made during an extensive meeting at the Town Hall yesterday evening, where councillors debated key financial allocations to ensure continued support for community services and infrastructure projects.

The budget includes substantial funding for essential public services such as waste management, street lighting, and road maintenance, reflecting the council’s commitment to maintaining high standards of living in Hastings. Additionally, a portion of the funds will be allocated towards cultural initiatives, aiming to enhance the town's reputation as a vibrant arts and heritage hub.

Councillor Emily Thompson, who chairs the Finance Committee, emphasized the importance of balancing financial responsibilities with community needs. 'This budget is not just about numbers; it’s about ensuring that every pound we spend benefits our residents directly,' she stated.

The council will now move forward to implement these budgetary measures, which are expected to have a positive impact on local businesses and residents alike. Details of the approved budget can be found on the Hastings Borough Council website for public review.
