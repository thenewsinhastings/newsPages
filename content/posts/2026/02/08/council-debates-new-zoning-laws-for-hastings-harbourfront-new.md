The Hastings & Rye Borough Council is set to discuss new zoning laws that could significantly alter the development landscape of Hastings harbourfront. The proposed changes aim to balance economic growth with environmental conservation, a topic of much debate within the community.

Council members will consider plans to limit commercial development and promote public spaces, aiming to preserve the area's natural beauty while supporting local businesses. Environmental groups have shown strong support for the proposal, arguing that it is essential for protecting Hastings' unique coastal environment from overdevelopment.

However, some business owners are concerned about potential restrictions on their operations and worry about the impact on job creation in the area. The council will hold public consultations before making a final decision, ensuring residents have an opportunity to voice their opinions and concerns.

This debate highlights the ongoing tension between economic interests and environmental protection within Hastings & Rye.
