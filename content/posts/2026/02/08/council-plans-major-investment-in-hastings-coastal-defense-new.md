The Hastings Borough Council has unveiled ambitious plans to bolster the town's coastal defenses against future storm surges and rising sea levels. The proposal, which includes a significant investment in flood barriers and reinforcement of existing seawalls, aims to protect both the historic town center and surrounding residential areas from potential flooding risks.

Council leader John Taylor highlighted the importance of these measures, stating, "Our coastline is a vital part of Hastings’ heritage and economy, but it also faces increasing challenges due to climate change. This investment is crucial for ensuring the long-term resilience and safety of our coastal communities."

The project has drawn interest from local residents, environmental groups, and businesses in the tourism sector, who have expressed support for the initiative while emphasizing the need for thorough consultation and community engagement throughout its development.

The council plans to present a detailed proposal at an upcoming public meeting scheduled for next month, inviting feedback from stakeholders before finalizing the project timeline. Residents are encouraged to attend and contribute their insights on how best to proceed with these critical infrastructure improvements.
