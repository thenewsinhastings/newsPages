The annual Hastings Charity Fun Run returned to the seaside town on Sunday, drawing hundreds of participants and spectators alike. Organised by local charity group Helping Hands, the event aims to raise funds for underprivileged children in the area.

Participants ranged from keen runners to families out for a leisurely walk, all united in their support for a good cause. The route wound through some of Hastings' most picturesque streets before finishing at the town's iconic seafront promenade.

Local businesses generously provided refreshments and raffle prizes to keep the energy high throughout the day. Volunteers from across the community ensured everything ran smoothly, from race marshalling to managing the post-race picnic area.

Among the many supporters was Councillor Jane Smith, who praised the event's impact on fostering a sense of unity within Hastings. 'Events like these remind us how powerful community spirit can be,' she said during her brief address at the finish line.

Proceeds from the Fun Run will go directly to Helping Hands' initiatives aimed at improving access to education and recreational activities for disadvantaged children in Hastings.
