In a significant move to bolster community facilities in Hastings, the local council has approved funding for the construction of a new community centre. The project aims to provide residents with an enhanced space for social gatherings, educational workshops, and cultural events.

Councillor Jane Smith, chair of the council’s finance committee, highlighted that the investment reflects the council's commitment to improving quality of life in Hastings. She stated, “The proposed centre will serve as a hub for community engagement and development, fostering stronger bonds among local residents.”

Details of the project include a state-of-the-art venue with ample room for various activities and events, catering to all age groups. The estimated cost is £5 million, which will be covered by a mix of council funds and external grants.

Construction is expected to begin in early 2024, with the centre scheduled to open its doors later that year. Community leaders have welcomed the decision, noting the positive impact it could have on local community cohesion and youth engagement.

For more information or updates regarding this project, residents can contact their local councillor or visit the council’s official website.
