The Hastings Borough Council has given the green light to a significant funding package aimed at enhancing the town's popular seafront. The initiative, part of the council's broader plan to boost tourism and improve quality of life for residents, includes upgrades to facilities such as lighting, seating areas, and accessibility features.

Councillor Jane Smith, who championed the proposal, stated that 'the investment in our seafront will not only attract more visitors but also provide a safer and more enjoyable space for all. We are committed to making Hastings a premier destination on the south coast.'

Opposition voices have praised the decision while calling for greater transparency regarding the allocation of funds from this budget towards other critical areas like education and healthcare.

Local businesses along the seafront have welcomed the news, believing it will help drive footfall during peak tourist seasons. The project is expected to commence in early spring next year.
