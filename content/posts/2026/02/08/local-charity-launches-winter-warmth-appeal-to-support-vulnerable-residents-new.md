In response to the cold winter months ahead, a local charity in Hastings and Rye has launched its annual 'Winter Warmth' appeal. The initiative aims to provide essential support for vulnerable residents who may struggle with heating costs or have limited resources during the colder season.

The charity is seeking donations of both money and warm clothing such as blankets, coats, and thermal underwear. These items will be distributed through partnerships with local community centers and social services to reach those in need across Hastings and Rye districts.

Community leaders are encouraging residents to contribute what they can, emphasizing the importance of coming together during challenging times. Local businesses have also pledged support by offering collection points for donations throughout town.

For more information on how you can help or to make a donation, please visit the charity's website at www.winterwarmth.org.uk.
