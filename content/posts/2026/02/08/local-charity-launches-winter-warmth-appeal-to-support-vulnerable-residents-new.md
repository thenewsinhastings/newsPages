In response to the cold winter months ahead, local charity *The Beacon of Hope* has launched its annual 'Winter Warmth Appeal' aimed at supporting vulnerable residents in Hastings and Rye. The initiative focuses on providing essential items such as blankets, heaters, and warm clothing to those who may struggle during the colder season.

Charity founder, Rachel Green, expressed her concern for the well-being of local families: “As temperatures drop, we see an increase in demand for our services. Our Winter Warmth Appeal is crucial in ensuring that no one feels the chill this winter.”

The charity welcomes donations of both new and used items at their headquarters located on Marine Drive, Hastings, or through online contributions via their website.

For more information or to make a donation, please visit *thebeaconofhope.org* or contact them directly on 01475 23689.
