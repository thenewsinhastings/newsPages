The Hastings Borough Council and Rye Town Council are set to debate a new recycling initiative aimed at reducing waste in the region. The proposal, which includes the introduction of stricter guidelines for household waste disposal and an increase in public recycling bins across key areas, has sparked mixed reactions from local residents.

Environmental groups have praised the move as essential for safeguarding Hastings and Rye's natural beauty and wildlife habitats. However, some community members are concerned about the potential impact on local businesses and the feasibility of implementing such a large-scale change without adequate support systems in place.

During Wednesday’s council meeting, councillors will discuss funding options and public engagement strategies to ensure the success of the initiative. The debate is expected to draw significant attention from both supporters and critics alike, highlighting the ongoing tensions between environmental sustainability and economic considerations within the community.
