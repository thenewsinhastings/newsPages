The council of Hastings and Rye has recently approved a new project aimed at improving access to the beach for local residents. The decision comes after months of debate and public consultations, with significant support from environmental groups but opposition from some business owners who fear increased foot traffic could lead to higher costs.

Council members voted in favor of installing additional walkways and signage along the coastlines of both Hastings and Rye. The project is expected to cost over £500,000 and will be funded through a mix of council funds and external grants.

The proposal includes enhancing beach access points that are currently difficult to reach due to steep terrain and limited infrastructure. Advocates argue that the improvements will not only enhance safety for visitors but also support tourism by making the area more accessible to people with disabilities or mobility issues.

However, critics have voiced concerns over potential disruption during construction phases and the impact on local business operations. Mayor of Hastings, Jane Smith, has assured residents that all necessary steps are being taken to minimize these impacts while maximizing long-term benefits for both tourists and locals alike.
