The Hastings Borough Council has been in heated debate over new initiatives aimed at enhancing public transport services within the district. The proposals, which include increasing bus frequency and exploring partnerships with neighbouring regions for improved rail links, aim to attract more visitors and residents to Hastings by making it a more accessible and convenient place to live or visit.

During yesterday's council meeting, councillors from various wards expressed their opinions on the matter, with some highlighting the potential economic benefits of enhanced transport options. Others raised concerns about funding and the impact of such changes on existing services and budgets.

The council is now seeking public feedback through a series of consultations in Hastings and Rye communities over the next two weeks. Residents are encouraged to attend these meetings or submit their views online to contribute to shaping future transport policies that will affect local mobility and economic growth.
