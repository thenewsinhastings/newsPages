Residents from Hastings and Rye turned out in large numbers on Sunday to participate in the annual charity walk, a local tradition that brings together people of all ages for a day of fun and fundraising.

Organised by the Hastings & Rye Community Trust (HRCT), this year's event raised over £50,000, with proceeds going towards supporting various community projects and initiatives. The walk, which started from Alexandra Park in Hastings and wound its way through picturesque Rye, saw participants donning bright colours and wearing homemade badges to show their support.

"It was fantastic to see so many people come out on what could have been a chilly autumn day," said HRCT's President, Jane Thompson. "The funds raised will make such a difference in our ability to help those most in need within the community."
