The Hastings Borough Council is set to review and potentially amend the current zoning laws that govern coastal development, according to a report released earlier this week. The proposed changes aim to address concerns about overdevelopment along the coastline, which has been a topic of heated debate among local residents and businesses.

Council members have received numerous petitions from citizens urging them to take action against further construction projects in sensitive marine areas, citing environmental risks such as erosion and damage to wildlife habitats. However, developers argue that these regulations could stifle economic growth by limiting investment opportunities within the town's seaside districts.

A public hearing is scheduled for next month where interested parties can voice their opinions on the proposed revisions. The council will weigh both sides of the argument before making a final decision expected sometime later this year.
