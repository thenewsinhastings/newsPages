The annual Harvest Festival returned to the town of Hastings this weekend, drawing hundreds of locals and visitors alike. The event, which has been a staple in the community for over two decades, featured a variety of activities including live music, food stalls offering traditional British fare, craft markets, and children's entertainment.

Organizers highlighted the importance of the festival as a platform for showcasing local produce and supporting small businesses. Over thirty local farmers and vendors participated this year, providing an array of fresh fruits, vegetables, and homemade goods that attracted crowds eager to taste the finest Hastings has to offer.

The success of the Harvest Festival would not be possible without the dedication of volunteers from across Hastings and Rye who spent weeks preparing for the event. They set up stalls, organized games for children, and ensured everything ran smoothly throughout the weekend.

This year’s festival also included a special focus on community health initiatives with local health clinics offering free screenings and advice sessions to promote wellbeing among residents.

As the sun began to set over Hastings Pier, attendees reflected on another successful Harvest Festival. With many already planning their return next year, there is no doubt that this beloved event will continue to bring joy and support to our community for years to come.
