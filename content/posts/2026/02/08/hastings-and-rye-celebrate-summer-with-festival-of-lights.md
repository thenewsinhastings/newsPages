Residents and visitors alike gathered in the heart of Hastings and Rye this past weekend to celebrate the arrival of summer at the annual Festival of Lights. The event, which has become a beloved tradition over the years, drew thousands with its mesmerising display of lanterns and fireworks along the coastline.

The festival not only showcased stunning artistic installations but also offered live music performances and food stalls serving local delicacies. Local councillor Emily Thompson praised the community's spirit in organising such an event that brings joy to so many. 'It’s wonderful to see our towns come together for a celebration of culture, arts, and heritage,' she said.

As the evening progressed, thousands watched from the shore as the sky lit up with a spectacular firework display. The organisers highlighted the importance of sustainability in their planning, ensuring that all materials used were biodegradable or recyclable to minimise environmental impact.

With another successful event behind them, the community looks forward to more gatherings and celebrations throughout the summer season.
