The Hastings and Rye Community Centre is delighted to announce the success of its inaugural annual summer festival. Held last weekend, the event attracted hundreds of residents from both towns who enjoyed a variety of activities including live music, local food stalls, children's games, and arts and crafts displays.

Organisers reported that the turnout was beyond expectations, with attendees praising the inclusive atmosphere and range of entertainment options. The festival featured performances by local bands and artists, offering an opportunity for up-and-coming talent to showcase their skills in a supportive environment.

Proceeds from the event will go towards maintaining community facilities and supporting youth programmes throughout Hastings and Rye. Plans are already underway for next year's festival, with organisers promising even more attractions and surprises.

Residents interested in getting involved or contributing to future events are encouraged to contact the Community Centre directly.
