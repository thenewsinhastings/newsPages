A local charity in Hastings has launched a new initiative aimed at providing support for vulnerable residents during the colder months. The campaign, named 'Warmth for Winter', will see volunteers visiting homes to deliver essential items such as food parcels and warm clothing. The organisation hopes that this effort will help mitigate the impact of harsh weather conditions on those most affected by poverty.

Charity coordinator, Jane Smith, commented: “We are delighted to be launching this vital service which is designed to ensure our community members stay safe and healthy during winter. Our dedicated team of volunteers are ready to make a difference.”

The initiative will focus particularly on elderly residents and families with young children who may struggle financially due to rising energy costs.
