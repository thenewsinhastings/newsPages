Residents of Hastings and Rye came out in full force this weekend to participate in the annual charity run, raising thousands of pounds for local hospitals. The event, which has been held for over a decade, saw hundreds of runners and walkers take part along scenic coastal routes.

Organised by the Hastings & Rye Running Club, the race included both 5K and 10K distances to cater to all levels of fitness enthusiasts. Local businesses also contributed generously, offering prizes and refreshments at the finish line.

According to Sarah Jenkins, Chief Reporter for our newspaper, 'The spirit of community is truly evident during this event as everyone comes together not just to celebrate health and fitness but also to support those in need.'

All funds raised from the race will be donated directly to the Hastings General Hospital Foundation Trust. Details on how you can contribute or participate next year are available on their website.
