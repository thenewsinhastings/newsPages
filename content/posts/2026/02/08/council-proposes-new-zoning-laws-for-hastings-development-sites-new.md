The Hastings Borough Council has proposed new zoning laws aimed at regulating the development of several key sites in Hastings. The initiative, part of a broader strategy to manage urban growth and preserve historical landmarks, will affect areas such as the Old Town and Stade neighbourhoods.

According to Councillor Sarah Green, who spoke on behalf of the council, the proposed changes are designed to ensure that new developments harmonize with existing architecture while providing much-needed modern amenities for residents. The plans also include stricter regulations on construction materials and design requirements to maintain Hastings' unique aesthetic appeal.

The proposal will be discussed at an upcoming public meeting scheduled for next month where local stakeholders and community members can voice their opinions and concerns. Councillor Green emphasizes that the council is committed to transparency and seeks active participation from the public in shaping this significant policy change.

Residents interested in learning more about the proposed zoning laws are encouraged to visit the Hastings Borough Council website or attend the upcoming meeting. The council aims to finalize these regulations by the end of the year, pending further consultation and adjustments based on feedback received.
