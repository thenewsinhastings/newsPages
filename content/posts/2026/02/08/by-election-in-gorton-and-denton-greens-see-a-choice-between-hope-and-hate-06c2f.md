The upcoming by-election in Gorton and Denton has been framed as a critical contest between the Green Party and Reform UK, with Hastings and Rye residents invited to consider what this national debate might mean for their local community. 

Zack Polanski, the leader of the Green Party, emphasized that voters are faced with an important decision that could significantly influence the political landscape at both a national and local level.

'This by-election represents more than just another vote,' said Mr. Polanski in a press statement. 'It's about whether we choose hope for a better future or succumb to hate and division.'

As Hastings and Rye residents prepare to cast their ballots, they are urged to consider the broader implications of this election on local issues such as environmental protection, community development, and the overall direction of regional governance.
