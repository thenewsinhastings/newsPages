The Hastings Borough Council has given the green light to a significant budget proposal aimed at revitalising Hastings Pier. The initiative, which includes funding improvements to the pier's structural integrity and adding modern amenities for visitors, was approved unanimously during last night’s council meeting.

Councillor John Wilson, who presented the motion, highlighted that the proposed investment will not only enhance the historical landmark but also contribute significantly to local tourism and economic growth. The project is expected to create temporary employment opportunities while boosting year-round visitor numbers to Hastings.

Local residents have expressed a mix of enthusiasm and concern about the changes ahead for their beloved pier. While many see it as an essential step towards preserving this iconic symbol of the town, others worry about potential disruptions during the construction phase.

The council’s decision follows months of discussions with stakeholders including local businesses, environmental groups, and heritage experts to ensure that the project balances preservation with modern needs.
