In a significant move towards boosting the cultural vibrancy of Hastings and Rye, the local council has approved an increase in funding for arts projects. The decision, which was made during yesterday’s full council meeting, will see an additional £50,000 allocated to support various initiatives over the next fiscal year.

The funds are intended to bolster existing programmes such as the Hastings Contemporary Art Festival and the Rye Arts Network, ensuring that these events can continue to attract both local residents and tourists. The move has been warmly welcomed by artists and cultural enthusiasts alike, who see it as a crucial investment in the area’s identity.

Councillor Jane Evans, responsible for culture at the council, highlighted the importance of arts funding in enhancing the quality of life within Hastings and Rye: “The arts play a vital role in shaping our community. By investing in local projects, we are not only supporting creative individuals but also contributing to the economic growth of the region.”

Opposition councillors expressed cautious optimism about the increase, noting that while cultural initiatives are valuable, they must be balanced with other pressing issues such as infrastructure and education.

This decision underscores the council’s commitment to fostering a thriving arts scene in Hastings and Rye. The full details of how these funds will be distributed are expected to be announced by the end of this month.
