The Hastings Borough Council held a heated debate on Monday regarding new housing development proposals for the town centre. The proposed project aims to revitalize an underutilized area, creating over 200 new homes and integrating community amenities such as parks and public spaces.

Proponents of the plan argue that it will boost local economic activity and provide much-needed accommodation options within the area. However, concerns have been raised about potential environmental impacts and disruption to existing residents during construction phases.

Local councillor Mark Thompson emphasized the need for careful consideration: 'While we understand the importance of expanding housing stock, we must ensure that this development aligns with our commitment to sustainability and community well-being.'

The council is expected to make a final decision on the proposal next month after further public consultations.
