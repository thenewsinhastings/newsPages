The Hastings Borough Council has approved a significant funding package to support the renovation and reinforcement of the Hastings sea wall. The project, aimed at protecting the town from severe coastal erosion, will receive £5 million in government grants and an additional £2 million from local council funds.

Councillor Sarah Green, leader of the Conservative group on Hastings Borough Council, stated that this investment is crucial for maintaining the safety and integrity of one of Hastings' most iconic structures. She added, 'This funding ensures we can take proactive measures to safeguard our coastline against future storms.'

The Labour opposition has welcomed the decision but has called for a review of how other coastal areas in East Sussex might benefit from similar support. Councillor Michael Turner emphasized the importance of a comprehensive approach to addressing regional sea defence needs.

Local residents and businesses, many of whom were affected by severe flooding last winter, have expressed relief at this development. The project is expected to commence later this year with completion scheduled for 2024.

The renovation will not only enhance the structural integrity of the wall but also include improvements in public spaces and amenities along the promenade, contributing positively to tourism and local economic growth.
