The Hastings Borough Council has approved a significant funding package aimed at enhancing coastal defences in the face of increasing climate risks. The decision follows a series of public consultations and expert assessments, which highlighted the urgent need for improved protection against storm surges and rising sea levels.

Council leader, Councillor Emma Taylor, commented: 'This is a vital step towards safeguarding our coastline and protecting both residents and businesses in Hastings and Rye. We have worked closely with local communities to ensure their concerns are at the heart of this decision.'

The funding will be used for immediate repairs as well as long-term projects designed to mitigate future risks. Environmental experts will continue to monitor the coast, providing regular updates to the council.

Local residents and businesses have expressed mixed reactions, with many welcoming the move but also voicing concerns about the potential impact on local finances. The council has assured them that efforts are being made to secure additional funding from central government sources.
