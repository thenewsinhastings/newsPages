The Hastings and Rye community came together this weekend to celebrate the annual summer festival, which featured a variety of activities for all ages. The event included live music performances, food stalls offering local delicacies, and children's games and crafts. Local businesses also participated by setting up booths to showcase their products and services.

The festival was organised by the Hastings & Rye Community Association (HARCA) in partnership with the town council, aiming to promote unity and support among residents while raising funds for community projects. Speaking at the event, HARCA President Jane Smith thanked volunteers and sponsors for their contributions, stating that such events strengthen local bonds and foster a sense of belonging within the community.

Residents were seen enjoying the sunny weather as they strolled through the town square, taking in the sights and sounds of the festival. The day concluded with a spectacular fireworks display that drew crowds from neighbouring towns.
