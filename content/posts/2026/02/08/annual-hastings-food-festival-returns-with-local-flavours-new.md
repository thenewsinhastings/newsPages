The much-anticipated Hastings Food Festival is set to return this summer, bringing together food lovers and local businesses for a day of culinary delights. The event will showcase the best that Hastings has to offer, with stalls offering everything from homemade cakes to artisan breads and fresh seafood.

Organisers are encouraging visitors to explore the diverse range of products on offer, many of which come straight from Hastings’ thriving markets and independent shops. This year’s festival promises to be bigger than ever before, with a dedicated children's corner featuring interactive cooking sessions and tastings designed to inspire young chefs.

Local businesses are excited about the opportunity to reach new customers while supporting each other through networking and collaboration opportunities provided by the festival organisers. With free entry for all visitors, this event is open to everyone who loves good food and enjoys celebrating local talent.
