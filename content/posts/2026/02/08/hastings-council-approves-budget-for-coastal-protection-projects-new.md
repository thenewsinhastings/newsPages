The Hastings Borough Council has unanimously approved the budget for coastal protection projects aimed at safeguarding the town's iconic seafront and protecting local residents from flooding. The £3 million investment will be directed towards reinforcing existing defenses, constructing new barriers, and enhancing drainage systems.

Councillor Richard Williams, Chair of the Environment Committee, stated that the measures are essential to mitigate the risks posed by rising sea levels and more frequent storm surges, ensuring the long-term resilience of Hastings' coastal areas. The projects will also include public engagement initiatives to involve local communities in decision-making processes related to future coastal management.

Local environmental groups have welcomed the news, praising the council for prioritizing proactive measures against climate change impacts. However, some residents expressed concerns about the potential disruption during construction and called for assurances regarding the timeline of the projects and their impact on day-to-day life.

The budget approval comes amidst ongoing discussions at both regional and national levels about increased investment in coastal defenses across East Sussex to protect vulnerable communities from future environmental challenges.
