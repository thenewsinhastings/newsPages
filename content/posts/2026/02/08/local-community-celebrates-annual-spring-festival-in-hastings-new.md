The sun shone brightly over the Hastings seafront as hundreds gathered to celebrate the annual Spring Festival. This year’s event, organised by the Hastings & St Leonards Society and supported by local businesses, brought together residents and visitors alike for a day of fun and festivities.

Highlights included an array of stalls selling homemade crafts and foods, live music performances from local bands, and workshops for children. The festival also featured a special charity section where attendees could donate to local causes like the Hastings Foodbank and Rye Community Centre.

Mayor Jane Thompson praised the event’s organisers and participants, stating: “This festival is a wonderful example of our community spirit in Hastings and Rye. It not only brings joy but also supports our local economy and helps those less fortunate.”

As the day drew to a close, the community came together for a group photo on the beachfront, marking another successful year for this beloved tradition.
