The coastal town of Hastings continues to witness a surge in community-driven efforts aimed at preserving its beautiful coastline. A group of dedicated volunteers, led by local environmental activist Jane Doe, initiated the Hastings Coastal Clean-Up Initiative last month. Since then, they have been working tirelessly to collect litter and debris from beaches, ensuring that this beloved natural resource remains clean and accessible for future generations.

This weekend saw an impressive turnout at the latest coastal clean-up event, where over 100 volunteers turned out despite inclement weather conditions. Local schools and businesses also contributed by providing essential supplies such as gloves and rubbish bags to support the cause.

Jane Doe expressed her gratitude towards all those who have shown their commitment to the environment. 'It’s heartening to see so many people coming together for a common goal,' she said. 'Every piece of litter we collect makes a difference.'

The Hastings Coastal Clean-Up Initiative plans further events throughout the year, inviting more residents and visitors alike to join in this important mission.
