The Hastings Borough Council has approved its budget for the coming year, focusing heavily on support measures aimed at helping local communities. The council's finance committee met earlier this week to discuss and ratify the new financial plan that allocates significant funds towards community projects such as improving public spaces, enhancing youth services, and supporting vulnerable residents.

According to Councillor Jane Foster, who chairs the finance committee, “This budget is a crucial step in our commitment to making Hastings a better place for all its residents. We have listened to feedback from the community and ensured that vital funding is directed towards initiatives that will directly benefit local people.”

The council has also pledged to maintain essential services while seeking innovative ways to reduce costs and improve efficiency. This includes exploring new partnerships with local businesses and charities.

Local residents and business leaders are generally welcoming the news, although some concerns have been raised about the potential impact on smaller community groups that may face funding cuts due to limited resources. The council has assured these stakeholders that every effort will be made to support those most affected by any changes in funding allocations.
