The Hastings Borough Council has approved a significant budget to revitalize the town's seafront, aiming to boost tourism and improve local amenities. The project, which includes new pathways, public art installations, and enhanced facilities for beachgoers, is expected to begin in spring next year.

Speaking at the council meeting, Councillor Jane Thompson, who chairs the Community and Leisure Committee, emphasized that the investment would not only enhance the aesthetic appeal of Hastings but also contribute to economic growth. 'This project will make our seafront more welcoming for both residents and visitors,' she said.

However, some local businesses have raised concerns about potential disruptions during construction. The council has assured them that measures are in place to minimize any adverse effects on trade and safety.

Residents of Hastings and Rye were generally supportive of the initiative, expressing hope for a cleaner and more accessible seafront area. Environmental groups also welcomed the plans, highlighting the importance of preserving natural beauty while enhancing public spaces.
