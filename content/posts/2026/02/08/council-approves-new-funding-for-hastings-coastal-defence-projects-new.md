The Hastings Borough Council has approved a significant budget allocation aimed at strengthening coastal defence projects in the Hastings and Rye area. The funding will be used to improve sea walls, upgrade beach management systems, and enhance early warning mechanisms for potential flooding events.

Councillor Jane Thompson, Chair of the Environment Committee, stated that this investment is crucial given the rising concerns over climate change impacts on coastal communities. She added that the projects are designed not only to protect properties but also to ensure the sustainability of local beaches as key tourist attractions.

The decision follows extensive public consultations and technical assessments by environmental experts who highlighted the critical need for robust infrastructure against sea-level rises and increased storm severity expected in the coming decades.

Residents are encouraged to participate in upcoming workshops where they can learn more about these projects and provide feedback. For those interested, more information is available on the council’s website under the 'Coastal Defence' section.
