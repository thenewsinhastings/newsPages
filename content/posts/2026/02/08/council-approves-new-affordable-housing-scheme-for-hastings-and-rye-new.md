The Hastings Borough Council has given the green light to a new affordable housing scheme aimed at addressing the ongoing housing crisis in both Hastings and Rye. The initiative, which was approved during Tuesday's council meeting, is set to provide up to 150 new homes for local residents who struggle with high housing costs.

Council leader Sarah Collins highlighted that the project will not only offer much-needed relief to individuals and families but also contribute positively to the economic stability of both towns. The scheme includes provisions for social rent properties as well as shared ownership options, catering to a range of financial situations within the community.

Local residents have expressed cautious optimism about the announcement, noting that affordable housing is essential to ensuring the ongoing vitality and diversity of Hastings and Rye. However, concerns remain regarding the pace of development and whether the scheme will adequately meet current demand.

The council's decision comes after months of consultation with local stakeholders, including developers, residents' associations, and environmental groups, emphasizing a commitment to balanced growth that respects both economic needs and sustainability principles.
