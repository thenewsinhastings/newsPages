The local charity 'Bridge of Hope' has launched a new initiative aimed at providing immediate support and long-term solutions for the homeless community in Hastings. The project, which includes provision of essential services like food, clothing, and medical care, will also offer housing assistance to help individuals transition from homelessness into stable living situations.

The launch event was attended by members of the local council who expressed their commitment to supporting the charity's efforts and integrating these initiatives with existing social welfare programs. The initiative is part of a broader community effort to address the growing issue of homelessness in Hastings, which has seen an increase over the past year due to economic challenges.

Bridge of Hope invites both individuals and businesses from across the region to contribute to this important cause through donations or volunteering opportunities. For more information on how you can get involved, please visit their website at www.bridgeofhope.org.
