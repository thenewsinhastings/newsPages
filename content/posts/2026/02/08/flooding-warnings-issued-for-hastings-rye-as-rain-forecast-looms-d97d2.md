The Met Office has issued a weather warning for Hastings and the surrounding area, advising residents to take precautions against potential flooding. Up to 30mm of rainfall is expected in some areas, which could lead to localised flooding, particularly in low-lying regions around Rye.

Local authorities are urging residents and businesses to review flood risk plans and ensure that necessary preparations have been made ahead of the anticipated rain event. Drains should be cleared, emergency kits prepared, and vulnerable properties safeguarded to mitigate any potential damage caused by heavy rainfall.

Further updates will be provided as conditions change and additional information becomes available.
