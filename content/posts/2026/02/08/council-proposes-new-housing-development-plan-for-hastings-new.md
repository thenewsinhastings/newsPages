The Hastings Borough Council has unveiled plans for a new housing development project aimed at addressing the ongoing housing crisis in the area. The proposal, which includes the construction of over 300 affordable homes across several sites within Hastings, was presented to members of the Planning Committee during their meeting on Monday.

According to council documents, the initiative is part of an extensive strategy to combat rising property prices and accommodate a growing population. Local politicians have emphasized the importance of this development for first-time buyers and families who are struggling with housing costs.

Residents and community groups will have the opportunity to provide feedback during a public consultation period scheduled for next month. The council has committed to reviewing all submissions before making any final decisions on the project.

Critics, however, have expressed concerns about potential environmental impacts and the displacement of existing residents in affected areas. These issues are expected to be addressed as part of the consultation process.
