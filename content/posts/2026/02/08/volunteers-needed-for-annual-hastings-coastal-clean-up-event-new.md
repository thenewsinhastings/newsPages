The town of Hastings is gearing up for its annual coastal clean-up event, aimed at preserving the beauty and cleanliness of the local beaches. This year's event promises to be bigger than ever with an increased focus on community engagement and environmental education.

Organisers from 'Keep Our Coastline Clean' are calling out to volunteers from both Hastings and Rye to join forces in tackling litter that washes up along the coastline, posing threats not only to aesthetic appeal but also to marine life and local ecosystems. Participants will be guided through proper recycling techniques and waste management practices during the clean-up.

Scheduled for Saturday, 15th April, starting at 9 AM at Rock-a-Nore Beach, this initiative aims to encourage a sense of responsibility towards environmental conservation among residents and visitors alike. Refreshments will be provided courtesy of local businesses showing their commitment to the cause.

For those interested in volunteering or seeking more information about how they can contribute to maintaining the cleanliness of Hastings' beaches, contact details are available on the event's official website and social media pages.
