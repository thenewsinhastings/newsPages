The Hastings Borough Council has approved a significant budget allocation to expand the local library in Hastings. The proposal, which was submitted by the council's finance committee, includes an investment of £500,000 for construction and renovation works aimed at improving facilities and community spaces within the existing library building.

Councillor Jane Greenhill, who chairs the finance committee, commented on the decision: 'The expansion will provide much-needed space for our growing community and offer enhanced services to residents. This investment in our library is an important step towards ensuring cultural resources are accessible and beneficial to all members of society.'

Local advocates have welcomed the announcement but also raised concerns about potential disruptions during construction. The council has assured that efforts will be made to minimise any inconvenience to patrons while work progresses.

The project is expected to commence in early 2024, with an estimated completion date set for late autumn of the same year. For more details and updates on the progress of this initiative, residents are encouraged to visit the Hastings Borough Council website or attend upcoming public consultations.
