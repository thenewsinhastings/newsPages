The Town Council of Hastings is set to introduce new zoning regulations aimed at modernizing the industrial sector within the town's boundaries. The proposed changes would allow for greater flexibility in land use, potentially paving the way for more sustainable and innovative business practices.

During a recent council meeting, councillors debated the merits of updating existing laws which have been in place since the 1980s. Supporters argue that these new regulations are necessary to attract modern industries that require space for advanced manufacturing and logistics operations.

Opponents of the proposal raise concerns over potential environmental impacts and traffic congestion, suggesting a more cautious approach is needed to balance economic growth with community well-being.

The council will hold public consultations in early April to gather feedback from local residents and businesses before making any final decisions. Further details about these consultations will be announced soon.
