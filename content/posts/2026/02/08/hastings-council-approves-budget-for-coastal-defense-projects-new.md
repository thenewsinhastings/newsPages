The Hastings Borough Council has given the green light to a new budget proposal aimed at strengthening coastal defenses in response to rising sea levels and increasing storm activity. The initiative, which includes plans for advanced flood barriers along the town's shoreline, is designed to safeguard both residents' properties and businesses from potential future damage.

During the council meeting last night, councillors debated the financial implications of the project but ultimately agreed that the investment was necessary for long-term protection against climate change impacts. The funding will also support improvements in local infrastructure, such as sea walls and drainage systems, to ensure they meet modern standards and withstand severe weather conditions.

Speaking after the vote, Councillor Sarah Green, chair of the Environment Committee, stated: 'This is a crucial step towards securing our coastal communities for future generations. We must act now to mitigate the risks posed by climate change.'

The project's implementation will begin in January 2024 and is expected to create jobs within the construction sector while providing long-term economic benefits through enhanced resilience against natural disasters.

Residents are encouraged to attend upcoming public consultations where they can learn more about the specific plans and provide feedback. Further details will be shared via the council's website.
