The Hastings and Rye Council has approved a series of budget cuts aimed at addressing the ongoing financial challenges facing the local government. The decision, which was made during a council meeting last night, includes reductions in funding for various community programs and infrastructure projects.

According to Mayor Jane Wilson, these measures are necessary due to reduced revenue from property taxes and increased costs associated with maintaining public services amid rising inflation rates. 'While no one likes making cuts,' she stated, 'we must ensure that our limited resources go towards essential services.'

Community groups have expressed concern over the potential impact of these budget reductions on local initiatives aimed at supporting vulnerable residents and enhancing the quality of life in Hastings and Rye.

The council is expected to present a detailed plan outlining how funds will be reallocated during its next public meeting scheduled for later this month.
