The Hastings Council has given the green light to plans aimed at reviving the iconic Hastings Pier. The project includes extensive renovations and modernizations designed to enhance its appeal as a tourist attraction and local gathering place.

Councillors voted unanimously in favour of the proposals, which include installing new lighting, improving accessibility for disabled visitors, and developing an events space that could host a variety of cultural activities throughout the year.

Project sponsors claim the initiative will not only boost tourism but also provide employment opportunities for locals. However, concerns have been raised about potential environmental impacts and the economic viability of such ambitious plans. Critics argue that without a clear strategy to attract sufficient footfall, the project risks becoming a financial burden on taxpayers.

The Mayor of Hastings & St Leonards, Councillor Mike Maltby, praised the council's decision: 'This is an exciting moment for our town, bringing hope and opportunity to many. We are committed to ensuring that the pier remains a cornerstone of our community’s social fabric.'
