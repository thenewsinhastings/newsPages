The local branch of the Reform party is facing an investigation following a printing error on campaign literature for the upcoming Hastings and Rye by-election. The leaflet, which was intended to provide information to voters, omitted crucial details that were required under electoral laws.

The Electoral Commission has confirmed that they are looking into the matter, but have stated that any potential criminal misconduct must be referred to law enforcement. This comes as a major setback for the Reform party in their efforts to secure votes within the Hastings and Rye constituency.

Party officials claim that the error was purely technical and blamed it on the printer who produced the leaflets. They have promised to cooperate fully with any investigation, emphasizing their commitment to adhering strictly to electoral regulations going forward.
