Residents of Hastings and Rye turned out in force on Saturday to celebrate the annual charity event, 'Unity for Good,' which aims to bring together community members to support local causes. The event featured a fun run, bake sale, and live music from local artists, all aimed at raising funds for several charities that benefit disadvantaged groups within the region.

Organisers reported record attendance this year, with over 500 participants contributing to the cause. Speaking at the event, Councillor Jane Williams highlighted the importance of such initiatives in fostering a sense of community and solidarity among residents. 'Events like these remind us of our collective responsibility to help those less fortunate,' she said.

All proceeds from Unity for Good will be distributed equally among five selected charities: The Foodbank Network, Homeless Haven, Green Futures Initiative, Hastings Seniors Support Group, and the Children's Wellness Fund. These organisations play a crucial role in addressing various social issues within our community.
