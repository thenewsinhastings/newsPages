In a significant move to rejuvenate the local economy and preserve a key landmark, Hastings Council has approved funding for the restoration of Hastings Pier. The project aims to breathe new life into the pier by addressing structural issues while enhancing its role as a cultural hub and tourist attraction.

The decision follows months of debate among council members and consultations with community groups, businesses, and residents. Key aspects of the budget include repairs to the wooden deck, improvements to safety measures, and investments in modernising facilities on the pier.

Councillor Sarah Green, who spearheaded the proposal, stated: 'This is a vital step towards revitalising our town centre and ensuring Hastings Pier remains at the heart of our community for generations to come.'

Local businesses have welcomed the news, seeing it as an opportunity to boost trade during peak tourist seasons. However, some residents are concerned about the potential impact on local traffic and parking.

The council will now seek funding from external sources including grants and private investment to support the project's ambitious goals.
