The council of Hastings and Rye has taken a significant step towards enhancing local green spaces, approving plans to create several community garden areas within the region. This initiative aims to promote environmental sustainability and provide residents with more opportunities for leisure and recreation.

Councillor Jane Thompson, who spearheaded the proposal, highlighted the importance of these projects in addressing both environmental concerns and social well-being. “Our goal is not only to improve the aesthetic appeal of our towns but also to foster a stronger sense of community among local residents,” she said during last week’s council meeting.

The proposed garden spaces will be located across various parts of Hastings and Rye, including urban areas that currently lack greenery. Plans include designated plots for community gardening, picnic spots, and play zones for children, ensuring that all age groups benefit from the new facilities.

Local residents have shown strong support for the project through public consultations conducted by the council earlier this year. A spokesperson for the council noted that over 80% of respondents expressed enthusiasm for increased green spaces in their neighbourhoods.

Construction is expected to begin next spring, with a phased approach to minimise disruption and ensure sustainability throughout the process. Residents are encouraged to keep an eye on local announcements for updates regarding specific locations and timelines.
