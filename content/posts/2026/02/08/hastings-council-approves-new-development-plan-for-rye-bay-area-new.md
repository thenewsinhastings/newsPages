In a significant move that promises to reshape the local landscape, Hastings Borough Council has approved a new development plan for the Rye Bay area. The proposal includes plans for mixed-use developments aimed at revitalising the coastal community while ensuring sustainable growth.

The council’s decision was met with a mix of reactions from residents and stakeholders in Rye. While some praised the initiative as essential to modernise and improve local infrastructure, others raised concerns about potential impacts on local ecology and historic sites.

James Ryder, Political Editor for our newspaper, stated: 'This development is an important step forward but also highlights the delicate balance between progress and preservation that Hastings & Rye face. It will be crucial to see how this project proceeds and addresses both economic growth opportunities and environmental protections.'

The plan includes provisions for green spaces, public facilities, and residential areas designed to cater to both current residents and anticipated new arrivals as a result of development projects. The council aims to hold consultations over the next few months to address community feedback and refine aspects of the proposal before final implementation.

Residents interested in learning more about the plans or wishing to contribute their views are encouraged to attend upcoming public sessions scheduled by the local council.
