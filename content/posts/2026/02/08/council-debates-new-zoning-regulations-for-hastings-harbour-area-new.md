The Hastings Borough Council met last week to discuss proposed changes to zoning regulations affecting the historic harbour area. The new rules, if passed, will impact both commercial and residential properties within a two-mile radius of the harbour.

Local businesses have expressed mixed opinions on the proposed amendments. Some merchants believe that stricter controls could enhance the aesthetic appeal and preserve the heritage of Hastings Harbour while others are concerned about potential economic repercussions for small enterprises already struggling to maintain profitability.

Councillors are reviewing feedback from public consultations which took place last month and will make a final decision at their next meeting scheduled for early November. The debate highlights ongoing tensions between preserving historical landmarks versus accommodating modern commercial needs in Hastings & Rye's vibrant coastal community.
