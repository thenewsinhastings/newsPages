The Hastings Borough Council held a crucial meeting this week to discuss the allocation of funds for local parks and green spaces within the upcoming budget. The decision is expected to have significant implications for residents who rely on these areas for recreation and community events.

During the session, councillors debated the pros and cons of cutting maintenance costs versus investing in improvements such as playground equipment upgrades and additional pathways. Environmental advocates urged the council to prioritize sustainable practices and ensure that natural habitats are preserved.

The council's final decision will be announced next month after further consultations with local stakeholders and community groups.
