The Hastings Borough Council has announced a public consultation regarding the proposed new housing development in Rye, set to begin next month. The plan aims to provide approximately 500 new homes over the next three years as part of the council's strategy to address local housing shortages and support community growth.

Councillor Susan Green, who is leading the initiative, highlighted that the proposals include a mix of affordable and market-rate properties with an emphasis on sustainable building practices. The council will also be working closely with environmental experts to ensure minimal impact on the surrounding natural habitats.

Residents interested in participating can attend one of several public meetings scheduled throughout January or provide feedback via the council's website. All input gathered during this consultation period will play a crucial role in shaping the final development plan, ensuring it meets the needs and aspirations of both Hastings and Rye communities.
