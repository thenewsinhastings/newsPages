In a significant move towards environmental sustainability, Hastings Borough Council has approved the implementation of a new recycling scheme aimed at reducing waste and promoting eco-friendly practices. The initiative was met with widespread support from local residents and businesses who are keen to see improvements in the borough's waste management.

The new scheme will introduce more frequent collection services for recyclable materials and educational workshops for community members on effective waste sorting techniques. Councillor Sarah Thompson, responsible for environmental matters, stated that 'the council is committed to making Hastings a greener place through these proactive measures.'

Opposition councillors have welcomed the decision but called for transparency in the allocation of funds and strict monitoring of the scheme's effectiveness. They urged the council to engage more closely with local community groups to ensure full participation in the new recycling efforts.

Residents are encouraged to familiarise themselves with the changes, which will come into effect from April 2023. For further details or assistance, contact Hastings Borough Council's Environmental Services department.
