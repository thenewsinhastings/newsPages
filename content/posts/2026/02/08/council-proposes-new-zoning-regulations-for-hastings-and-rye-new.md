The Hastings Borough Council has put forward a proposal to amend the zoning laws that govern commercial development in both Hastings and Rye. The proposed changes aim to limit the number of new retail outlets and fast-food chains within residential areas, focusing instead on promoting local businesses and preserving the historical character of these coastal towns.

Councilor Jane Thompson, who heads the Planning Committee, stated at a recent meeting that the amendments are necessary due to concerns over traffic congestion and loss of community identity. The proposal will be open for public consultation for two months before the council makes a final decision.

Local residents have expressed mixed opinions on the proposed changes. While many support the idea of protecting local businesses and preserving the town’s unique atmosphere, others worry that the restrictions could hinder economic growth and job creation opportunities in Hastings and Rye.
