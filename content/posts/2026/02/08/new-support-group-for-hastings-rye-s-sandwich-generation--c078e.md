In response to the growing challenges faced by individuals juggling work responsibilities with caring for both young children and elderly parents, a new support group has been established in Hastings & Rye. The initiative aims to provide a space where members can share experiences, advice, and coping strategies to combat burnout.

The 'sandwich generation' refers to those aged 35-60 who find themselves caught between the demands of family obligations at both ends of life's spectrum. Local experts emphasize that without adequate support systems, this group is increasingly prone to stress and fatigue.

Organisers hope the club will serve as a lifeline for many in Hastings & Rye, offering workshops on time management, emotional resilience, and access to local resources that can alleviate some of the burdens they face.
