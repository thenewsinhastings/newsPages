The Hastings Town Council held a heated debate this week on the proposed new affordable housing initiative. The scheme aims to address the growing concern over rising housing costs and the impact on local residents, particularly younger families and those on lower incomes.

Councillor Jane Roberts, who leads the committee overseeing the project, highlighted that the proposal includes measures such as increased subsidies for first-time buyers, grants for social housing projects, and incentives for developers to include affordable units in new builds. She stressed the importance of finding a balance between economic growth and ensuring that all residents can afford to live comfortably within their community.

Opposition councillors raised concerns about the potential impact on local businesses and the overall cost-effectiveness of the scheme. They argued that while the initiative is well-intentioned, there may be more effective ways to tackle housing affordability that do not risk harming other aspects of the town's economy.

The public has shown significant interest in this proposal, with numerous residents attending last night’s council meeting to voice their opinions and concerns. A local petition supporting the initiative has gathered over 500 signatures, underscoring the urgency many feel about addressing the housing crisis.

Council members will continue discussions on the affordable housing initiative at next month's full council meeting where they will decide whether to proceed with a formal vote.
