The Hastings Borough Council has unanimously approved new zoning laws aimed at revitalising the town centre while ensuring its historic charm is preserved. The decision, which comes after months of public consultation and debates, seeks to balance commercial growth with residential needs.

Councillors highlighted concerns about over-commercialisation in recent years and stressed the importance of maintaining Hastings' unique character. The new laws will permit mixed-use developments that allow for a blend of retail spaces, offices, and housing, encouraging a vibrant yet sustainable urban environment.

Local residents expressed mixed reactions to the decision, with some welcoming the prospect of more job opportunities and amenities while others voiced worries about potential changes in property values and traffic congestion. The council has pledged to monitor developments closely to address any emerging issues promptly.

The new zoning laws will come into effect next month and will apply specifically to properties within Hastings Town Centre, with a focus on creating a harmonious balance between commercial enterprises and residential areas.
