The Hastings Council has unanimously approved plans to construct a new community hub in the heart of Hastings. The proposed facility will serve as a central location for various social services, including youth programs, senior citizen activities, and job training workshops. Construction is expected to begin next spring with an estimated completion date by the end of 2024.

Mayor Jane Smith highlighted that the new community hub is part of the council's broader strategy to enhance local infrastructure and strengthen community bonds within Hastings. "This project represents a significant investment in our town’s future," she stated during the council meeting, emphasizing its importance for fostering inclusivity and providing essential services to all residents.

Local residents have expressed mixed reactions regarding the development. Some are excited about the potential benefits it will bring, while others raised concerns over parking issues and increased traffic congestion once construction begins. The council has assured them that measures will be put in place to mitigate these challenges during the building phase.
