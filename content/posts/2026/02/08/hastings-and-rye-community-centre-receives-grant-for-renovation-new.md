The Hastings and Rye Community Centre has been awarded a significant grant from the East Sussex County Council to undergo extensive renovations, aiming to improve facilities for local residents. The project will include upgrades to the community hall, an expansion of the children’s play area, and improvements to accessibility throughout the site.

Speaking at a recent council meeting, Councillor Jane Thompson highlighted the importance of this investment in community infrastructure, stating, “This grant is a testament to the hard work of our local representatives and the needs expressed by Hastings and Rye residents. We are committed to ensuring that our community centres remain vibrant hubs for social interaction and community activities.”

The renovation works are scheduled to begin in early 2024, with an estimated completion date towards the end of the year. Local volunteers have been invited to participate in planning meetings to ensure their input is considered during the design phase.

Residents interested in volunteering or learning more about the project can contact the Hastings and Rye Community Centre directly.
