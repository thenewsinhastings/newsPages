The Hastings Borough Council is set to unveil a series of proposals aimed at revitalizing the town's historic harbour. The plans, which include improvements to infrastructure and public spaces, have sparked debate among local residents and business owners who are divided over the potential benefits and drawbacks.

Proponents argue that modernization is essential for attracting visitors and boosting economic growth. However, critics express concerns about preserving the area’s historical integrity and fear that changes could disrupt existing businesses.

The council has scheduled public consultations to gather feedback from the community before finalizing the proposals. The initiative reflects a broader push by local authorities to enhance Hastings' appeal while balancing heritage conservation with development needs.
