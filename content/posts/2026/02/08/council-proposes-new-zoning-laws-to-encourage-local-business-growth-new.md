The Hastings and Rye Council has proposed a set of new zoning laws aimed at encouraging the growth of local businesses within the borough. The council asserts that these changes are crucial for revitalizing the economy, creating jobs, and fostering a stronger sense of community identity.

According to Mayor Emma Foster, the new legislation would facilitate easier access to commercial spaces in both Hastings and Rye town centres. Specific provisions include relaxed restrictions on operating hours, flexible use of property space, and incentives for businesses that prioritize sustainability and local sourcing.

The proposals have been met with mixed reactions from residents and business owners. While many welcome the potential economic boost, others are concerned about traffic congestion and changes to the character of their communities.

A public consultation period is scheduled to begin next month, allowing citizens to provide feedback on the proposed changes before they go to a full council vote later in the year.
