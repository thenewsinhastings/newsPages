The Hastings & Rye Council has given the green light to a proposal for the construction of a new community center in the heart of Rye. The project, which will be funded by a mix of council grants and private donations, aims to provide residents with an array of facilities including a library, sports hall, and social areas.

The decision comes after months of debate and public consultations about where best to locate the facility and what services it should offer. Councillor Sarah Green, who chairs the Community Services Committee, stated that the new center will serve as a focal point for community activities and events, enhancing the quality of life for Rye residents.

Local residents have expressed mixed feelings about the plan. While many welcome the prospect of improved amenities, others are concerned about potential disruption during construction and the impact on local traffic and parking.

The council has assured that measures will be put in place to mitigate these issues, including temporary traffic diversions and additional car parking arrangements nearby. Construction is expected to begin in the spring next year, with completion scheduled for late 2024.
