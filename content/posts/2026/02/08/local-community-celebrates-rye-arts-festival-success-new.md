The annual Rye Arts Festival concluded this weekend with a celebration of local talent and community spirit. Over the course of seven days, the festival featured an array of events including workshops, exhibitions, live performances, and public art installations.

Organisers reported that despite challenging weather conditions earlier in the week, attendance was higher than anticipated, with visitors from across Hastings & Rye district and beyond flocking to enjoy the cultural offerings. The event not only showcased local artists but also provided a platform for emerging talents.

'The success of this year’s festival is a testament to the vibrancy and creativity of our community,' said Jane Smith, Festival Director. 'We are thrilled with how well it was received and look forward to continued growth in future years.'

Local businesses have praised the event for driving footfall and boosting trade during traditionally quieter periods.

Plans are already underway for next year’s festival, promising even more engaging activities and a broader scope of artistic expressions.
