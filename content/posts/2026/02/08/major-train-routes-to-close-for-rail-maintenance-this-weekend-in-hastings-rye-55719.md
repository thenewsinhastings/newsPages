Residents and visitors of Hastings and Rye are advised that key train routes will be closed this weekend as part of essential rail maintenance work taking place across the South East. The closures affect services in both Hastings and Rye stations, impacting travel for those commuting or heading out to explore the region.

The engineering work is scheduled to take place on Saturday and Sunday, with local trains operating only between selected stops outside these times. Passengers are strongly advised to check National Rail's live service updates before setting off to avoid delays and find alternative routes if necessary.

Transport officials urge travellers to plan their journeys ahead of time and use local bus services where available as a substitute for the closed rail links. Additional buses may run on peak times to help accommodate the extra demand.
