Hastings and Rye are gearing up for an exciting week as local charities across the two towns come together to celebrate their impact on the community. From food banks to environmental projects, residents have the opportunity to get involved in a variety of initiatives throughout the week.

The event aims to raise awareness about the work being done by these organisations and encourage more support from the local populace. Activities include charity runs, bake sales, and information sessions for those interested in volunteering or making donations.

Local charities such as the Hastings Food Bank, Rye Community Garden, and the Coastal Clean-Up Initiative have planned a series of events to engage with the public and showcase their efforts over the past year.

For more details on how you can participate, visit the official charity week website or check local community boards for event schedules.
