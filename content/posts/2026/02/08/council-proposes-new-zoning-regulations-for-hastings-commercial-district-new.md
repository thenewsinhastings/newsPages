The Hastings Borough Council has announced a proposal to revise zoning regulations in the heart of the city's commercial district. The proposed changes aim to promote economic development by encouraging mixed-use developments and increasing density in key areas.

According to Councillor Maria Smith, who heads the Planning Committee, these new rules are designed to address current challenges such as limited parking space and a lack of affordable housing options for young professionals moving into the area. She noted that there will be a public consultation period lasting until mid-August where local residents and business owners can provide feedback.

Community groups have already expressed mixed views on the proposals. The Hastings Chamber of Commerce supports the initiative, seeing it as an opportunity to revitalise the downtown core and attract more investment. However, concerns have also been raised about potential traffic congestion and the impact on existing businesses that may struggle to adapt to new regulations.

The council plans to hold several public meetings in both Rye and Hastings over the next few weeks to gather input from a broad range of stakeholders before making any final decisions.
