The Hastings and Rye community is rallying around a local charity this winter season as they launch their annual Winter Warmth Appeal. The initiative aims to support vulnerable members of the community who are struggling with heating bills and food shortages during the colder months.

Local volunteers have been busy collecting donations, including warm clothing, blankets, and non-perishable food items for distribution across Hastings and Rye. Residents are encouraged to contribute by dropping off their donations at designated collection points located throughout both towns.

Speaking about the appeal, Sarah Johnson from the charity highlighted the importance of community support: “This year has been particularly challenging due to rising energy costs, but with the help of our amazing volunteers and generous donors, we’re making a real difference in people’s lives.”

The charity also provides assistance through their emergency fund, offering financial aid for essential heating needs. To donate or volunteer, residents can contact the charity directly via their website.

For those who would like to get involved but aren’t sure how, local organizers suggest starting with small actions such as sharing information about the appeal on social media or helping to distribute flyers in their neighbourhood.
