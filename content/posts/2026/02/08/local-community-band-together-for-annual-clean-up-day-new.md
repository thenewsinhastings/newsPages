Residents of Hastings and Rye joined together last Saturday for the annual Clean-Up Day, a community initiative aimed at improving local parks and beaches. Over 200 volunteers rolled up their sleeves to collect litter and debris from various locations across both towns.

Organised by the Hastings and Rye Environmental Group (HREG), this year's event saw an increase in participation compared to previous years. The group, which advocates for sustainable practices and environmental awareness, was pleased with the community response.

"It’s wonderful to see so many people coming together to take care of our environment," said Jane Thompson, chairperson of HREG. "Each year we aim to make a difference in small ways, but when hundreds of individuals work collectively, it makes a huge impact." 

Volunteers collected over 300 bags worth of litter from Hastings Pier and the surrounding areas, as well as Rye Harbour and Castle Mill Stream. The initiative also included planting new flowers and shrubs around public spaces to enhance the natural beauty of both towns.

In addition to environmental benefits, local businesses reported increased footfall during the event, with visitors enjoying cleaner surroundings. This underscores the positive impact such community-driven projects have on tourism and economic vitality within Hastings and Rye.
