In a recent meeting of the Hastings Borough Council, councillors unanimously voted to increase funding for coastal defence projects aimed at protecting residents in both Hastings and Rye from severe weather events. The proposed budget allocation reflects an understanding of the growing threat posed by rising sea levels and more frequent storm surges.

The additional funds will be used to upgrade existing flood barriers, improve drainage systems along the coastlines, and initiate new construction projects designed to enhance resilience against future climate impacts. Councillor Emma Taylor, speaking on behalf of the council, emphasised the importance of this investment for long-term community safety and economic stability.

Residents in both towns have expressed mixed reactions to the decision. While some welcome the proactive approach towards infrastructure development, others remain concerned about potential disruptions during construction phases and the overall financial burden placed on local taxpayers.

The environmental impact assessment will be conducted over the next six months, with public consultations scheduled for early autumn. This process aims to gather input from all stakeholders including coastal businesses and homeowners who may be directly affected by these changes.
