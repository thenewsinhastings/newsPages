The Hastings and Rye Council is set to debate a new waste management policy aimed at reducing the environmental impact of local waste disposal. The proposal includes increased recycling targets, expanded community composting initiatives, and stricter penalties for non-compliance.

Councillors will discuss the financial implications of the proposed changes, including potential increases in council tax contributions to fund the improvements. Local residents have been invited to provide feedback on the proposals through a series of public consultations scheduled over the next month.

James Ryder, Political Editor, highlights that while the move is seen as positive by environmental campaigners and local green groups, there are concerns about how these changes will be implemented without placing undue financial burdens on local households.
