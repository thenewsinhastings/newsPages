The Hastings Borough Council has given the green light to a proposal that will see the construction of a new community centre in the town's Stade area. The decision, which was made at this week’s council meeting, aims to provide local residents with an additional space for social activities and events.

Councillor Jane Thompson, who spoke on behalf of the committee responsible for the project, highlighted that the facility will serve as a hub for community groups and clubs, offering resources and facilities that are currently limited in the Stade region. She stressed the importance of such investments in fostering a sense of belonging among residents.

The proposed centre is expected to include a multi-purpose hall, meeting rooms, kitchen facilities, and outdoor spaces suitable for both social gatherings and sports activities. The total cost of the project has been estimated at £2 million, with funding secured through a combination of council contributions and grants from regional development programmes.

Local residents have shown significant interest in the plans, with many attending public consultations to voice their support and suggestions for improvements. A spokesperson for the local community expressed enthusiasm about the potential benefits this new centre could bring, such as increased opportunities for intergenerational activities and improved mental health through social engagement.

The construction is expected to begin early next year, pending final planning approvals and completion of pre-construction surveys. Once operational, the community centre will be managed by a partnership between the council and local volunteers, ensuring that it remains responsive to the needs of its users.
