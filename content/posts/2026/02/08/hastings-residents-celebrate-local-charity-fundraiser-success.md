Last weekend saw the annual Hastings and Rye Charity Fun Run and Festival take place at Alexandra Park, bringing together over 500 participants from across East Sussex. The event raised a record-breaking £12,000 for local causes including mental health support services and community development projects.

Organised by the Hastings Community Foundation, this year's festival featured live music performances from local bands, a marketplace of stalls selling handcrafted goods, and children’s activities such as face painting and balloon modelling. The 5K run started at Victoria Place before heading towards Rye Harbour and back to Alexandra Park.

Speaking about the event's success, event coordinator Jane Smith expressed her gratitude: “It’s fantastic to see our community come together in support of these vital charities. We couldn’t do it without all the volunteers who give up their time and local businesses that provide us with sponsorship.”

The funds raised will be distributed among several organisations that focus on improving quality of life for residents within Hastings and Rye, including mental health services and youth clubs.

As the event concludes its third year running, organisers are already planning for next year’s festival to build upon this year's record-breaking success. Community involvement remains at the heart of these events.
