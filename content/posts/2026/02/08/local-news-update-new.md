  "body": "The Hastings Borough Council has approved a significant funding allocation to enhance coastal defences in the town, addressing long-standing concerns over flood risks and erosion. The decision was made at a council meeting on Thursday evening and includes £2 million for immediate improvements and an additional £500,000 for ongoing maintenance.

The funding will be used to upgrade existing sea walls, construct new barriers where needed, and implement environmental measures such as beach nourishment to protect the coastline. The project is part of a wider initiative aimed at safeguarding coastal communities from the increasing threat of climate change-induced flooding.

Councillor Jane Smith, chair of the council’s Environment Committee, said: 'This investment demonstrates our commitment to protecting our residents and businesses against the impacts of climate change. We have been working closely with local stakeholders, including environmental groups and engineering experts, to ensure that these improvements are both effective and sustainable.'

Local residents have expressed mixed feelings about the decision, with some welcoming the support for coastal protection while others have raised concerns over potential disruption during construction.

Dr. Alan Mercer, an independent environmental consultant based in Hastings, commented: 'This is a positive step towards mitigating future risks, but it’s important that we continue to advocate for greater national funding and policy changes to tackle climate change at its source.'

The council will now begin the tendering process for contractors to start work on the project as soon as possible. Residents interested in participating in public consultations or learning more about the project can contact their local councillor or visit the council's website."
