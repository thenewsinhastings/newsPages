  "body": "The Hastings and Rye Borough Council has approved a new initiative aimed at addressing the ongoing housing crisis by introducing more affordable homes for local residents. The plan, which was passed during last night's council meeting, includes the development of several new housing projects within both Hastings and Rye towns.

According to Councillor Jane Smith, who spoke in favor of the proposal, “This is a significant step forward for our community as it aims to provide more affordable options for first-time buyers and families struggling with rising house prices.”

The initiative includes the conversion of existing properties into affordable housing units and the construction of new homes on previously underutilized land. Critics argue that while the scheme represents progress, it may not be enough to alleviate the acute shortage in affordable homes.

Local residents are cautiously optimistic about the outcome. “It’s great to see action being taken, but there is still a lot more work needed,” said resident Mark Thompson during an interview with our reporter Sarah Jenkins.

The council has set aside £2 million for this project over the next two years and plans to seek further funding from government grants and partnerships with private developers."
