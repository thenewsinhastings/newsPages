  "body": "The Hastings Borough Council is set to introduce a new budget proposal aimed at addressing the financial challenges faced by the local community. The council's finance committee, chaired by Councillor Jane Smith, has proposed an allocation of funds that prioritizes essential services such as education and health care while seeking to cut non-essential expenditures.

The proposed budget also includes investments in infrastructure projects designed to stimulate economic growth in Hastings and Rye. A major focus is the redevelopment of the seafront area to attract more tourism and businesses. However, concerns have been raised by some councillors about the potential impact on local residents if further services are scaled back to meet financial targets.

Councillor Smith stated that the budget proposal is a necessary step towards ensuring long-term sustainability for the borough. 'We need to make tough decisions now to secure our future,' she said in a press conference at the Town Hall yesterday. The council will hold public consultations over the next few weeks, inviting residents and businesses to provide feedback on the proposed changes.

The budget debate is expected to be a key topic during the upcoming council meeting scheduled for February 24th, where councillors will vote on whether to approve the new financial plan."
