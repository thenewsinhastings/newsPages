The event, organised by Hastings Borough Council and Rye Town Council, attracted a large crowd eager to see who would be honoured with awards for categories such as Volunteer of the Year, Youth Achievement, and Lifetime Contribution.

Among this year's recipients was John Smith, a long-time volunteer at the local food bank in Rye. Mr Smith was recognised for his dedication over many years to helping those in need within the community. Speaking after receiving his award, Mr Smith said, 'It is an honour to be acknowledged by my peers and I hope it encourages others to get involved.'

Another notable recipient was Emma Jones, who received the Youth Achievement Award for her work raising awareness about mental health issues among young people through a series of workshops and seminars she organised at local schools.

The ceremony also featured performances from local musicians and school choirs, adding to the celebratory atmosphere. Councillor Sarah Green, Mayor of Hastings, praised the award recipients during her speech: 'Each one of these individuals is making our communities stronger and more vibrant through their hard work and selflessness.'

As the event concluded, many attendees agreed that it was a wonderful showcase of the rich community spirit in Hastings and Rye."
