The event, organized by the Hastings & Rye Community Foundation, honoured individuals in various categories such as volunteer of the year, community leader of the year, and youth achievement.

Among the winners was Jane Thompson from St Leonards-on-Sea, who received the Volunteer of the Year award for her dedication to supporting elderly residents through a local food bank. Another notable winner was Mark Evans, recognized for his work in revitalizing the Rye Market Place and fostering community engagement.

The awards not only highlight individual achievements but also underscore the importance of collective effort in making Hastings and Rye vibrant and welcoming places to live.
