In a meeting held yesterday at Hastings Town Hall, councillors debated the proposed budget cuts aimed at addressing the economic downturn affecting both Hastings and Rye. The council has been under pressure to balance essential services with financial constraints, leading to heated discussions on how best to allocate resources.

Proposed measures include reductions in funding for community programs and public amenities, which could impact local residents significantly. Councillor Jane Smith highlighted the need for a balanced approach that considers both fiscal responsibility and the welfare of Hastings' citizens.

During the debate, councillors expressed concerns over the potential long-term effects of these cuts on small businesses and social services in Rye as well. Mayor Thomas Williams assured the public that the council remains committed to supporting local communities while navigating these challenging times.

The council will reconvene next week to finalize decisions regarding budget allocations for the upcoming financial year, with updates expected to be made available to the public soon.
