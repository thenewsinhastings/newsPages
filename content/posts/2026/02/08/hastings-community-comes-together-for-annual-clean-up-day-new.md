Hundreds of volunteers descended upon Hastings and Rye on Saturday as part of the annual town clean-up day. Organised by local community groups, the event saw residents and visitors alike come together to beautify public spaces and promote environmental awareness.

The initiative began early in the morning at various locations throughout both towns, including beaches, parks, and residential areas. Volunteers collected litter, planted flowers, and painted benches to improve the appearance of their beloved seaside community.

"It's wonderful to see everyone coming together for a common cause," said Jane Smith, one of the event organisers. "This day not only improves our environment but also strengthens our sense of community." She added that such collective efforts help foster positive relationships among residents and tourists alike.

Local businesses supported the clean-up by providing refreshments for volunteers and participating in activities themselves. The day concluded with a celebratory gathering where participants shared their achievements and discussed plans for next year's event.

For more information on future community projects or to volunteer, contact the Hastings Community Group via their website.
