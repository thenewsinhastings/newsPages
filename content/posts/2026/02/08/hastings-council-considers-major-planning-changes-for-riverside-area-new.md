The Hastings Borough Council is set to consider significant changes to the planning regulations concerning the development of the riverside area. The proposed alterations aim to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability and community needs.

Councillors are due to debate the new rules at their next meeting, where they will also discuss public feedback gathered during a recent consultation period. Local residents have been vocal about preserving open spaces while developers argue that modern infrastructure is necessary for attracting businesses and creating jobs.

James Ryder, Political Editor, highlights that this decision could set a precedent for future developments in Hastings and beyond. He notes the importance of finding common ground between the interests of local stakeholders and the broader economic goals of the area.
