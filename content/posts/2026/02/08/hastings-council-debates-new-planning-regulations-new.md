The Hastings Borough Council held a heated debate last night over proposed new planning regulations that could significantly impact the local housing market and development sector. The council is considering stricter guidelines aimed at preserving the character of historic buildings while allowing for necessary modernization to meet contemporary demands.

During the public consultation period, numerous residents voiced concerns about potential restrictions on home extensions and renovations, which they argue could hinder their ability to maintain their properties. Conversely, local conservation groups have praised the proposals as vital steps towards protecting Hastings' unique architectural heritage.

Councillor Sarah Thompson expressed her support for the initiative, stating, “These regulations are necessary to safeguard our historic sites while also addressing pressing issues such as overcrowded housing and urban sprawl.” However, opposition from several property developers suggests that the new rules might stifle economic growth in an already challenging market environment.

The council is expected to make a final decision on these proposals at their next meeting in two weeks. Local residents and businesses are encouraged to submit any additional feedback before then.
