Residents of Hastings and the nearby town of Rye joined forces last weekend to participate in the annual charity fun run, raising funds for local children's hospitals. Over 500 runners took part in the event, which started at the heart of Hastings Pier and wound its way through scenic coastal paths before ending back at the pier.

The event was not only a testament to the community spirit but also served as a reminder of the importance of supporting local healthcare initiatives. Local businesses contributed by setting up stalls along the route, offering refreshments and prizes for participants.

Organiser Jane Thompson expressed her gratitude towards all those who participated or supported the run: 'We couldn't have done it without the generosity of our sponsors and the enthusiasm of runners and their families.' The charity fun run has become a highlight in the community calendar, drawing people from various backgrounds to come together for a common cause.
