The Hastings Borough Council is set to debate a new initiative aimed at addressing the ongoing housing affordability crisis in the town. The proposal, which seeks to allocate £2 million from the council's budget towards building and renovating affordable homes for local residents, has sparked considerable interest among councillors.

Supporters argue that the move will help alleviate some of the strain on young families and low-income earners struggling with soaring property prices. Critics, however, are concerned about the financial implications and potential delays in other community projects.

During tonight's council meeting, councillors will also discuss additional measures to support local businesses affected by recent economic challenges. The debate promises to be lively as stakeholders from across Hastings weigh in on these important issues.
