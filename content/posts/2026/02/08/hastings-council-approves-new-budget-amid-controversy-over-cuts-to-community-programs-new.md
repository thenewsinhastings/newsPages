The Hastings Borough Council has approved a new budget for the upcoming financial year, which includes significant cuts to several community programs. The decision comes after weeks of debate and public consultation.

According to Mayor Sarah Davies, the council faced tough choices due to reduced government funding and increased costs in areas such as social care and infrastructure maintenance. "We understand the impact this will have on our local communities," said Davies, "but we believe these measures are necessary to ensure long-term financial sustainability."

The budget proposal sparked controversy among residents and community leaders, who argue that the cuts threaten essential services for vulnerable groups in Hastings and Rye. Local organizations such as the Community Support Network (CSN) have launched a petition calling on councillors to reconsider their decisions.

"These programs are lifelines for many families," said CSN director Karen Johnson. "We urge council members to find alternative solutions that do not compromise the well-being of our most vulnerable citizens." The council has scheduled public meetings in the coming weeks to further discuss these concerns and seek feedback from the community.
