The town of Hastings celebrated the grand opening of its new youth centre on Saturday, marking a significant milestone for local community development. The event saw numerous young people, along with parents and local officials, gather to celebrate this initiative aimed at providing a safe space for recreation and personal growth.

Located in the heart of Hastings, the modern facility will serve as a hub for various activities including sports programs, arts workshops, and educational support sessions. Local youth workers have been trained specifically for the new centre, ensuring young people are supported with a range of services tailored to their needs.

Councillor Jane Thompson, speaking at the opening ceremony, highlighted the importance of such facilities in addressing the social and emotional well-being of young residents. 'This centre is not just about providing fun activities,' she said, 'but also offering a place where our youth can develop essential life skills.'

The project was funded through a combination of local council grants and private donations, demonstrating a strong community effort to improve local amenities.

Residents in both Hastings and Rye are encouraged to support this initiative by participating in upcoming events and volunteering their time. The centre plans to host an open day next month where the entire community is invited to learn more about its services.
