The Hastings and Rye Council has approved a new initiative aimed at increasing the supply of affordable housing within the district. The project, which was discussed during Tuesday's council meeting, will see £5 million allocated to support the development of 100 new homes specifically designed for low-income families and young professionals struggling with high rent prices in the area.

Councillor Jane Smith, who presented the proposal, stated that “this initiative is a crucial step towards addressing the housing crisis we are facing. The lack of affordable options has been pushing many residents out of our community, which can’t be allowed to continue.” She added that the council hopes this investment will not only provide much-needed homes but also stimulate local economic growth and improve social cohesion.

Opposition councillors have welcomed the move while calling for more significant action in the longer term. They argue that while the current proposal is a step in the right direction, it does not go far enough to solve the underlying issues of housing supply versus demand. Residents are encouraged to attend public consultations scheduled for early next month to provide feedback and contribute ideas towards making this initiative as effective as possible.
