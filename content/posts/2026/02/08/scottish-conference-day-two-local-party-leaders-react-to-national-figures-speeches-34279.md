Local party leaders in Hastings and Rye are reflecting on the speeches given by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana at the second day of Your Party's Scottish conference. While the main event took place north of the border, local members have been following updates closely to see how the developments might affect their own campaigning efforts.

Jeremy Corbyn's address focused on themes of unity and solidarity within the party, inspiring those who attended remotely from Hastings and Rye. Zarah Sultana spoke about the importance of community engagement and grassroots activism in building a strong political movement.

Local political figures have expressed enthusiasm about these messages and their applicability to their own local campaigns. They believe that the insights gained during the conference will help them engage more effectively with voters in Hastings and Rye, fostering stronger connections within their communities.

As Your Party continues to grow and establish its presence across different regions of the UK, the voices from Scotland are being closely monitored by local leaders who aim to replicate some of this momentum in their own backyard.
