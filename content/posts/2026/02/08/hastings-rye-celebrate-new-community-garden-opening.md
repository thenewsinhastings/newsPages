In a heartwarming display of community spirit, Hastings and Rye residents came together on Saturday to celebrate the opening of a new community garden. Located in the heart of the town centre, this green space has been transformed over the past year by local volunteers who have worked tirelessly to plant flowers, trees, and shrubs that will provide both aesthetic beauty and ecological benefits.

The project was initiated by the Hastings Community Group with the aim of creating a tranquil oasis for residents and visitors alike. Over 200 people attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony, including local councilors who praised the initiative as an example of community-led regeneration.

During the event, organizers shared their vision for the garden to serve not only as a recreational area but also as an educational hub where children can learn about gardening and wildlife conservation. Future plans include workshops on sustainable practices and seasonal planting events.

Speaking at the opening, Sarah Thompson, chair of Hastings Community Group, expressed her gratitude towards all those who contributed to making this project a reality. 'This garden represents more than just green space; it's a symbol of what can be achieved when communities come together with shared goals,' she said.

The new community garden is open daily from 9 AM to dusk and offers a perfect setting for locals to unwind, socialize, and connect with nature.
