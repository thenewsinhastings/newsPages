The Hastings Borough Council has proposed a series of major housing developments aimed at addressing the ongoing shortage of affordable homes in both Hastings and Rye. The plans, which will be discussed at an upcoming Planning Committee meeting, include new builds within existing urban areas as well as greenfield sites.

Supporters argue that these initiatives are crucial for attracting young families back to the region while also accommodating the growing population. Critics, however, have raised concerns over potential environmental impacts and the displacement of current residents.

The proposals will be open for public consultation in coming weeks, allowing local residents to voice their opinions before decisions are finalized.
