The Hastings Borough Council held a meeting yesterday to discuss the pressing issue of coastal erosion along the town’s shoreline and its impact on tourism. Council members presented their latest findings from an environmental assessment, highlighting that without immediate intervention, tourist numbers could significantly decrease in future years.

Councillor Jane Smith outlined plans for a proposed beach replenishment project costing £5 million, which would involve importing sand to restore eroded beaches and install sea defenses. The council is seeking funding support from both the local enterprise partnership and central government departments to implement this scheme.

During the meeting, various stakeholders expressed their concerns over potential environmental impacts of such measures on marine wildlife and emphasized the need for a thorough ecological assessment before proceeding with any large-scale intervention projects.

The upcoming summer season is crucial for Hastings’s tourism industry; therefore, councillors will be working closely with local businesses to ensure that any proposed changes are communicated clearly and sensitively. The council also pledged to provide regular updates on progress regarding coastal management initiatives in the coming months.
