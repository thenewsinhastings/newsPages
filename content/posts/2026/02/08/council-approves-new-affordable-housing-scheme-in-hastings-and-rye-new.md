The Hastings Borough Council has given the green light to a new affordable housing scheme, aiming to address the ongoing housing crisis in both Hastings and Rye. The initiative includes the construction of over 150 new homes designated for key workers and families with lower incomes.

Speaking at last night's council meeting, Councillor Jane Harper highlighted that the development will not only provide much-needed accommodation but also stimulate economic growth by creating jobs during the construction phase. She emphasized the importance of balancing community needs with environmental sustainability.

Local residents have mixed feelings about the proposal. While many welcome the prospect of more affordable housing options, concerns have been raised regarding traffic congestion and potential strain on local amenities. A public consultation is scheduled to take place in the coming weeks, allowing residents to voice their opinions before final approval.

The new scheme is part of a wider strategy by the council to tackle the shortage of affordable homes across Hastings and Rye. Critics argue that more must be done to ensure the development does not become yet another statistic in the city’s ongoing housing debate.

For more information, residents are encouraged to attend the upcoming public consultation meetings or visit the official council website.
