The Hastings and Rye Community Fund has announced the recipients of its latest round of grants, providing a financial boost to several local projects aimed at enhancing community life in both towns.

Among the successful applicants is the Rye Art Gallery, which received £2,500 for an exhibition on local history. The funds will support the display of artifacts and photographs that tell the story of Rye’s past, ensuring it remains a vibrant part of the town's cultural scene.

In Hastings, the Friends of All Saints Church group was awarded £1,800 to restore stained glass windows dating back to the 19th century. This project will not only preserve an important piece of local heritage but also bring together volunteers and residents interested in preserving the area’s historical character.

The Community Fund committee highlighted that these projects exemplify the type of initiatives they aim to support: those which enrich cultural experiences, connect communities, and safeguard local history for future generations. Applications are now open for the next round of funding with deadlines set for early January 2024.
