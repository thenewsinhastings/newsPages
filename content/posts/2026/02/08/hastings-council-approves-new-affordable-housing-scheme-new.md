The Hastings Borough Council has given the green light to a new affordable housing initiative aimed at addressing the town's housing crisis. The scheme, which will see the construction of over 150 new homes within the next two years, is part of the council’s broader strategy to make homeownership accessible for local residents and key workers.

Councillor Sarah Thompson, who spearheaded the proposal, highlighted that the initiative includes provisions for social housing as well as affordable home ownership options. She emphasized the importance of collaboration with private developers to ensure both financial viability and community support.

Local concerns about displacement due to rising property prices were addressed during council meetings, where assurances were given regarding measures to mitigate negative impacts on existing low-income residents. The scheme also includes plans for improved public transportation links to enhance accessibility for all members of the Hastings & Rye communities.

The project will be closely monitored by local advocacy groups and community leaders to ensure it meets its goals of increasing affordable housing stock while maintaining the character and vibrancy of Hastings and its neighboring villages.
