In a well-attended public forum held last Thursday evening in the Hastings Town Hall, local residents gathered to express their concerns over recent changes to bus routes and service reductions within the town. The event was organized by the Hastings & Rye Transport Committee in response to growing community dissatisfaction with reduced frequency on several key routes.

Among the issues raised were the removal of weekend services from popular tourist areas such as the Old Town, which has been a significant source of local revenue during peak seasons. Many attendees also highlighted difficulties faced by commuters relying on public transport for daily travel needs, particularly students and the elderly.

Local resident Mrs. Jane Davies said, 'The lack of adequate service is making it increasingly difficult to access necessary amenities like healthcare facilities or supermarkets. We are worried about how this will affect our ability to live independently as we age.'

Representatives from Hastings Borough Council were present at the meeting and assured attendees that efforts would be made to assess the impact of recent changes and seek potential solutions in collaboration with transport providers.

The forum concluded with a call for increased community engagement on future planning decisions, emphasizing the importance of considering local residents' needs when implementing such changes.
