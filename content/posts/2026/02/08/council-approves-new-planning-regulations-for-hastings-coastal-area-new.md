The Hastings Borough Council has approved new planning regulations aimed at enhancing coastal development while preserving the town's historic character. The decision was made during a council meeting on Tuesday, which saw councillors from across the political spectrum engage in detailed discussions about the future of Hastings' coastline.

The new guidelines will impact developers and residents alike, focusing on sustainable construction practices, increased green spaces, and stricter controls on high-rise buildings along the coast. Council leader Jane Smith highlighted that these measures are crucial for protecting Hastings’ unique heritage while supporting growth and development in the area.

Environmental groups have welcomed the changes, praising the council's commitment to balancing economic interests with environmental concerns. However, some local business owners expressed concern over potential challenges in securing funding for renovations under the new regulations.

Residents are encouraged to attend upcoming public consultations where they can provide feedback on specific projects and express their opinions regarding the implementation of these new rules. The council will continue to monitor the impact of these changes and make adjustments as necessary.
