Residents of Hastings and Rye came together this weekend for a community beach clean-up initiative. Over 150 volunteers, ranging from local families to members of environmental groups, gathered at three different locations along the coastline.

The event was organized by the Hastings & Rye Coastal Clean-Up Team with support from the local council. The team’s aim is not only to reduce litter and debris on the beaches but also to raise awareness about marine conservation issues within the community.

Volunteers collected over 20 bags of waste, including plastics, glass bottles, and fishing nets that can be harmful to marine life. Community leader Emma Johnson commented, 'It's heartening to see so many people coming together for such a vital cause.'

The success of this initiative has led the organizers to plan further clean-up events throughout the year, aiming to create a cleaner and more sustainable environment along Hastings and Rye's beautiful coastline.
