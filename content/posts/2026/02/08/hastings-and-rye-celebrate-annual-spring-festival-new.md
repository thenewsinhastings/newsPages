The annual Spring Festival in Hastings and Rye kicked off this weekend with a vibrant celebration of local arts, crafts, and community spirit. Hundreds of residents and visitors alike came together to enjoy a day filled with live music, art exhibitions, and family-friendly activities.

In Hastings, the event was held at Alexandra Park where stalls lined the main path, offering everything from handmade jewelry to locally grown flowers. Local artists showcased their latest works in an exhibition tent that drew crowds all afternoon. Children were entertained by face painting and a range of games while adults sampled local produce and drinks.

Across the river in Rye, the festival took on a more historical theme with reenactments of traditional spring celebrations from centuries ago. Visitors could witness costumed performers demonstrating crafts like weaving and pottery, providing an educational yet fun experience for all ages.

Mayor Sarah Thompson expressed her enthusiasm about the event: 'It's fantastic to see our communities come together in such a positive way. The Spring Festival is not just about enjoying good weather and company but also supports local businesses and brings us closer as neighbors.'

The festival continues through Sunday, offering something for everyone who wants to participate or simply enjoy being part of the Hastings and Rye community.
