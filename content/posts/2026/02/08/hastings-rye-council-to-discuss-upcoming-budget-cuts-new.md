The Hastings & Rye Council is set to deliberate on a series of proposed budget cuts aimed at addressing the financial challenges faced by local government. The council meeting, scheduled for next week, will focus on identifying areas where spending can be reduced without compromising essential services.

According to Councillor Sarah Thompson, chair of the finance committee, the primary goal is to balance the budget while preserving core services such as waste management and education. 'We are committed to maintaining our commitment to the community despite challenging times,' she stated during a press conference yesterday.

The proposed cuts include reductions in funding for public art projects and non-essential maintenance works across both towns. Community groups have expressed concern over potential impacts on local cultural activities, with some calling for alternative solutions such as community-led fundraising efforts.

Residents are encouraged to attend the council meeting or submit their feedback via the official website before the final decision is made in December.
