The Hastings Borough Council has proposed new zoning laws aimed at regulating development within the town's borders. The initiative, which would see stricter controls on building heights and limits on commercial property expansion, is intended to preserve the historic character of Hastings while also addressing growing concerns about traffic congestion and housing affordability.

Council leader Sarah Thompson explained that the proposals are a response to public feedback collected over the past year, which highlighted the need for better management of growth. 'We want to ensure that our town remains both attractive to visitors and liveable for residents,' said Thompson during a press conference last week.

The proposed changes have not been without controversy; local developers have expressed concerns about potential delays and increased costs associated with adhering to more stringent regulations. However, environmental advocates are supportive of the measures, praising them as essential steps toward sustainable urban planning in Hastings.

Public consultations on the new zoning laws will begin next month, providing an opportunity for residents and stakeholders to voice their opinions before the final decision is made by the council.
