The local charity, Hands Up for Help, has launched its annual Winter Warmth appeal to support vulnerable residents across Hastings and Rye during the colder months. The initiative aims to provide essential winter supplies such as warm clothing, blankets, and food parcels to those in need.

Speaking at a press conference today, founder and CEO of Hands Up for Help, Lisa Carter, highlighted the importance of community support: 'As we approach winter, it’s crucial that our most vulnerable neighbours are kept safe and comfortable. The Winter Warmth appeal is more vital than ever this year due to rising energy costs.'

Local residents and businesses can contribute by donating items or volunteering their time at collection points located in Hastings town centre and Rye market square.

For more information on how to get involved, visit the Hands Up for Help website.
