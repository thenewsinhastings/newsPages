The Hastings Borough Council has unanimously approved the new budget for the upcoming financial year. The decision comes at a time when the local economy faces significant challenges due to ongoing national economic uncertainties.

During a heated debate, councillors discussed various strategies aimed at balancing the need for essential services with the pressing requirement of supporting small businesses and residents affected by rising living costs and inflation.

The approved budget includes an increase in funding for community projects such as youth facilities and support services for elderly care. However, some councillors expressed concerns over potential cuts to arts and cultural initiatives due to financial constraints.

Mayor John Thompson highlighted the importance of collaboration between local government and businesses to ensure the town's economic resilience: 'It is crucial that we work together to foster an environment where our community can thrive despite national challenges.'

Local business leaders have welcomed the commitment to supporting small enterprises, seeing it as a vital step towards stabilizing the local economy. Nevertheless, there are calls for additional measures to address rising property taxes and utility costs faced by homeowners.

As Hastings continues to navigate these economic headwinds, residents will be looking closely at how the approved budget translates into tangible support and relief.
