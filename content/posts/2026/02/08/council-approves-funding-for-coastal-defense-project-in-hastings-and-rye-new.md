In a unanimous decision on Monday night, the Hastings Borough Council approved £5 million in funding to support the Coastal Defense Project. This initiative aims to fortify coastal defenses against rising sea levels and increasing storm frequency, which threaten both communities.

The project will include the construction of new sea walls, installation of breakwaters, and enhancement of existing beach nourishment programs. Local residents have expressed mixed reactions; while some welcome the proactive approach to protecting their homes and businesses, others are concerned about potential environmental impacts on local wildlife habitats and marine ecosystems.

Councillor Sarah Thompson, Chair of the Environment Committee, emphasized that 'this investment is crucial for safeguarding our communities against future climate risks. We have been working closely with environmental experts and community groups to ensure a balanced approach.'

The council will now move forward with detailed planning and public consultations in both Hastings and Rye over the next six months before construction begins.

Residents interested in learning more about the project are encouraged to attend upcoming public meetings, details of which can be found on the Council's website.
