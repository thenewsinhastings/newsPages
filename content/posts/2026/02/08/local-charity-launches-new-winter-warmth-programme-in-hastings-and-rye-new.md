A local charity based in Hastings has launched a new initiative aimed at providing essential winter support to vulnerable residents across both Hastings and Rye areas. The Winter Warmth Programme offers assistance with heating costs, clothing donations, and community outreach events designed to ensure that all members of the community stay safe and warm during the colder months.

The charity’s spokesperson said: “Our aim is to make a tangible difference in our communities by addressing some of the most pressing needs this winter. We are calling on local businesses and individuals to support us through donations, volunteering, or spreading awareness about the programme.”

For more information on how to get involved or to find out about upcoming events, please visit [Charity Website] or contact their offices directly.
