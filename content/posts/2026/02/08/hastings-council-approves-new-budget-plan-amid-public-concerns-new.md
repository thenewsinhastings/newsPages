The Hastings Borough Council has recently approved its new budget plan for the upcoming financial year. The decision, which includes significant changes to council services and funding allocations, was met with mixed reactions from the public.

During a heated meeting last week, councillors discussed various options aimed at balancing the books amidst challenging economic conditions. Key proposals included cuts to community programs, increased fees for local amenities, and investments in essential infrastructure projects.

Residents have expressed concerns about the potential impact of these changes on local communities. Critics argue that reducing funding for social services will exacerbate existing issues such as poverty and homelessness. Council leaders, however, maintain that the new budget is necessary to ensure long-term sustainability and improve vital services like roads and utilities.

Mayor Jane Thompson highlighted the council's commitment to transparency and public engagement throughout the process. She stated, 'We have listened to our residents' feedback and aimed to strike a balance between financial responsibility and social support.'

The budget plan now awaits final approval from the Secretary of State for Local Government before being implemented in April 2024.
