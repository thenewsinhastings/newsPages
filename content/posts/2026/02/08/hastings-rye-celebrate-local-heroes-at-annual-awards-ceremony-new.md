The Hastings and Rye communities came together last night for the annual awards ceremony, honouring individuals who have made significant contributions to their local areas. Hosted by the Town Hall, the event celebrated a diverse range of achievements from community service to environmental conservation.

Among the awardees was Jane Thompson, recognised for her dedication to helping homeless individuals in Hastings through her volunteer work with Shelter Plus. Another notable recipient was Mark Evans, who received an award for his pioneering work in promoting sustainable living practices across Rye.

"These awards are a testament to the spirit of collaboration and civic engagement that defines our community," said Councillor Sarah Green from the Local Council. "Every year we witness remarkable acts of kindness and dedication that enrich our town's social fabric."

The ceremony also featured speeches from local leaders, emphasizing the importance of supporting such initiatives which foster a stronger sense of community.
