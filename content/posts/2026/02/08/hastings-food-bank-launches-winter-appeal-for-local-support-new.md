In response to the increasing demand for food assistance during the colder months, Hastings Food Bank has launched a winter appeal. The initiative aims to collect essential items such as canned goods, pasta, rice, and hygiene products to support local families in need.

The food bank, which operates out of St. Michael's Church Hall on Wednesdays from 10 am to 2 pm, reports that visits have surged by 50% compared to last year due to rising energy costs and economic pressures. Volunteers are urging the community to contribute generously to ensure no one goes hungry during this challenging time.

Sarah Jenkins, Chief Reporter, spoke with Angela Thompson, coordinator of Hastings Food Bank: 'We are deeply grateful for every donation that comes our way,' said Angela. 'Our mission is to provide a helping hand and warm hearts to those who might otherwise struggle through the winter months.'

Residents interested in donating or volunteering can contact Hastings Food Bank directly at [email]info@hastingsfoodbank.org.uk[/email]. The community's support is vital in ensuring that local residents are able to access essential food items during this critical period.
