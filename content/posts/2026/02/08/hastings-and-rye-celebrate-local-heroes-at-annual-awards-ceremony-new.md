The community of Hastings and Rye came together on Saturday evening to celebrate the achievements and contributions of local residents at the annual awards ceremony. Held in the grand town hall, this year's event honoured individuals across various categories including volunteer work, educational excellence, and environmental stewardship.

Among the recipients was Margaret Thompson from Hastings, who received the Volunteer of the Year award for her dedicated service at the local food bank. “It’s a real honour to be recognised in this way,” said Ms. Thompson during her acceptance speech. “Our community is so supportive, it makes me want to do more every day.”

The Environmental Champion Award was presented to Jake Green from Rye for his efforts in establishing a sustainable gardening initiative within the community garden. His project has not only beautified public spaces but also promoted eco-friendly practices among local residents.

This year’s ceremony, which attracted over 300 attendees, highlighted the rich tapestry of contributions made by Hastings and Rye’s inhabitants towards creating a vibrant and supportive community environment.
