The Hastings Borough Council has approved a series of budget cuts affecting various services in both Hastings and Rye, impacting local residents and businesses. The decision was made during the council meeting on Thursday, with councillors voting to reduce funding for leisure facilities, community centres, and transport services.

The move follows a consultation period where residents and stakeholders were invited to provide feedback on potential budget cuts proposed by the council. Despite receiving widespread opposition from many members of the public who attended virtual town hall meetings, the final vote reflected a majority support for reducing costs amid financial constraints.

Among the affected areas are swimming pools, libraries, and local parks in Hastings, while Rye will see reductions in transport services such as bus routes and community events funding. The council claims these measures are necessary to balance the budget after facing significant revenue losses due to the ongoing economic challenges posed by national lockdowns.

Councillor Jane Thompson, who spoke during the meeting, stated that “these decisions were not made lightly. We understand the impact this will have on our community but believe it is essential for ensuring long-term sustainability of services.”

Local businesses and organisations have expressed concern over these changes, with some already reporting a decrease in patronage due to reduced access to community resources.

Residents interested in learning more about how these cuts might affect them are encouraged to visit the council’s website or attend upcoming public consultations scheduled for next month.
