Residents from both Hastings and Rye joined forces this weekend for a major beach clean-up initiative, aiming to restore the natural beauty of local beaches while raising awareness about marine conservation. Over 200 volunteers turned out on Saturday morning, armed with bags, gloves, and determination.

The event was organized by the Hastings & Rye Marine Conservation Group in partnership with the local council's environmental department. Participants collected an impressive amount of litter, including plastics, fishing nets, and other debris that can harm marine life.

Councilor Jane Thompson praised the efforts of volunteers: “This shows the community’s commitment to protecting our natural heritage and demonstrates the positive impact we can achieve when people work together.”

Organizers plan to hold similar events throughout the year to maintain cleaner beaches. They also hope to engage local schools in future initiatives, educating younger generations about environmental stewardship.
