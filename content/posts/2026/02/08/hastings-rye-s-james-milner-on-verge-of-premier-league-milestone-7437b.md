Local football hero and former Hastings youth player James Milner is set to equal the Premier League record for most appearances, just 24 years after his debut as a teenager. The milestone comes during an upcoming match against Brentford at the Amex Stadium on Sunday.

Milner, who began his professional career with Bradford City in 1999 before joining Leeds United and later Manchester City, has been a key player for Brighton & Hove Albion since moving to the club in 2018. His journey from playing for Hastings Youth Football Club to potentially matching the record of 645 appearances set by Peter Breck is an inspiration to many local football enthusiasts.

The match will not only celebrate Milner's career longevity but also highlight his contributions to the vibrant football culture of Hastings and Rye, two towns that have seen their fair share of young talent grow into Premier League stars.
