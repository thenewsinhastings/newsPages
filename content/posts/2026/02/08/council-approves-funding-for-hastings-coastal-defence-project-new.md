The Hastings Borough Council has approved funding to commence the first phase of a major coastal defence project aimed at protecting the town's vulnerable coastline from erosion and flooding. The project, which was proposed by the local council earlier this year, will see investment in state-of-the-art sea defences and improved drainage systems along the beachfront.

Councillor Sarah Thompson, leader of the council’s environment committee, stated that the initiative is crucial to safeguarding Hastings’ economy and way of life. 'This project is not just about protecting our residents; it's also about preserving the local heritage and ensuring that businesses can thrive without fear of natural disasters,' she said.

The funding decision was met with approval from environmental groups and local business owners who have long advocated for such measures due to recent severe weather events along the coast. However, some residents expressed concerns over the potential disruption caused during construction and requested regular updates on progress and impact minimization strategies.

Residents are encouraged to attend upcoming public consultations to voice their opinions and stay informed about the project’s development.
