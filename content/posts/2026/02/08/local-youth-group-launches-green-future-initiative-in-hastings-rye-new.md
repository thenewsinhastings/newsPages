In a bid to promote sustainability and environmental awareness among young people, the local youth group 'Eco Warriors' has launched an ambitious new project called 'Green Future'. The initiative aims to encourage residents of all ages to adopt eco-friendly practices that will contribute to a cleaner and greener Hastings & Rye.

The launch event, held at the Town Hall on Friday evening, was attended by community leaders, local councillors, and enthusiastic young volunteers. Speaking at the event, Emma Thompson, leader of 'Eco Warriors', said: “We are thrilled to see such strong support from our community for this vital initiative. The Green Future project will not only educate youth but also provide practical solutions for environmental challenges we face today.”

Key activities under the 'Green Future' include regular beach clean-ups, tree planting in local parks, and educational workshops on recycling and renewable energy sources. The group is inviting schools and other community organisations to join them and participate in these efforts.

Councillor Peter Miles, who represents Hastings Ward, praised the youth's initiative: “This project showcases how young people can lead positive change in their communities. We are committed to supporting 'Eco Warriors' as they work towards a sustainable future.”
