The Hastings and Rye community is rallying behind a new initiative aimed at supporting local businesses during these challenging economic times. The scheme, launched by the local council in partnership with business owners and residents, includes a series of workshops and networking events designed to help small enterprises adapt and thrive.

Councilor Jane Thompson commented, 'We recognize the vital role that our local businesses play in the fabric of our community. By providing resources and platforms for them to connect and share ideas, we hope to foster an environment where everyone can benefit.'

The initiative is open to all business owners within Hastings and Rye and will be rolled out over the next few months with a series of scheduled events that focus on topics such as digital marketing strategies, financial planning, and customer engagement.

Residents are encouraged to participate by attending these sessions or nominating their favorite local businesses for recognition. For more information on how to get involved, visit the official community website.
