The Hastings and Rye Borough Council has announced the launch of a community consultation regarding an extensive coastal defence project aimed at protecting both towns from future flooding and erosion risks. The initiative comes in response to recent severe weather events that have highlighted vulnerabilities along the coastline.

Residents are encouraged to participate in upcoming public meetings where they can voice their concerns, suggestions, and ideas for improving the existing sea defences. These discussions will be critical in shaping the final project design and ensuring it meets the needs of local communities.

The council has committed significant funding towards this essential infrastructure upgrade, which is expected to enhance not only safety but also economic stability by protecting businesses and homes located near the shoreline. Further details about meeting dates and locations will be shared through local media outlets in the coming weeks.
