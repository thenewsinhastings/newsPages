The sun shone brightly as Hastings and Rye celebrated their annual summer festival last weekend. The event, now in its third decade, brought together residents from all over the two towns for a day filled with music, food, and family fun.

Organised by local volunteers and supported by Hastings Borough Council and Rother District Council, this year's theme was 'Celebrating Our Community'. Attractions included live bands playing on multiple stages throughout the day, arts and crafts stalls showcasing local talent, and delicious street food from around the world. Children enjoyed inflatables, face painting, and a host of games designed to keep them entertained.

Attendees praised the event's ability to bring people together, with many commenting on how it strengthened community bonds and provided an opportunity for everyone to celebrate the unique culture that Hastings and Rye have to offer. Plans are already underway for next year’s festival, which promises even more surprises and activities to engage both old attendees and newcomers.
