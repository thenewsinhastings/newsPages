The Hastings and Rye community centre has announced a major expansion of its services, aiming to better support local residents in the face of increasing social challenges. The new initiatives include additional mental health support groups, enhanced youth programmes, and an expanded food bank.

"We are thrilled to be able to offer these new resources," said Jane Smith, the community centre's director. "With the rising cost of living affecting many families, it is more important than ever that we provide comprehensive assistance for those in need." 

The expansion has been made possible through a combination of local government funding and donations from the community. The centre hopes to continue to grow its services with ongoing support.

Residents interested in learning more about the expanded offerings are encouraged to visit the Hastings & Rye Community Centre or check their website for details.
