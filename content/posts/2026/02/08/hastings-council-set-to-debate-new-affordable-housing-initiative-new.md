The Hastings Borough Council is set to debate a new initiative aimed at increasing the number of affordable housing units in the area. The proposal, which will be discussed at the upcoming council meeting, includes measures to incentivize developers to build more social and affordable homes for local residents.

According to sources within the council, the proposed scheme could see significant changes to current planning regulations to make it easier for developers to create additional housing options for those in need. The initiative is part of a wider effort by the council to address the ongoing housing crisis affecting many Hastings families.

Local councillor and spokesperson for the Affordable Housing Task Force, Jane Thompson, said: 'This proposal aims to alleviate the pressure on our current housing market and provide much-needed support to those struggling with high rents and property prices. It’s a crucial step towards ensuring that all residents of Hastings have access to safe and affordable homes.'

The public is invited to attend the council meeting next week, where they can voice their opinions on this important issue.
