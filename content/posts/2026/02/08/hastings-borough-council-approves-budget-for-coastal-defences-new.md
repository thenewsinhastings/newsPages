In a significant move to protect the East Sussex coastline from further erosion and flooding, Hastings Borough Council has approved a substantial budget allocation towards coastal defence projects. The council has committed £2 million for immediate repairs and an additional £5 million over the next five years for long-term infrastructure improvements.

The decision was met with approval from local residents and businesses who have been affected by recent storms that caused significant damage to sea walls along the coast. Council leader, Councillor Mary Thompson, emphasised the importance of this investment in safeguarding Hastings' future and preserving its heritage for generations to come.

Environmental experts attending the council meeting highlighted the critical need for these measures due to the increasing frequency of extreme weather events linked to climate change. The funds will be used to repair current infrastructure, improve flood defences, and implement innovative technologies aimed at reducing erosion.

The announcement has also raised concerns about funding gaps in other areas of the council’s budget, leading some councillors to call for a review of priorities and potential cuts in less critical spending sectors. However, the majority view is that protecting Hastings from coastal threats is paramount to ensuring economic stability and quality of life for local residents.

The next steps include detailed planning and public consultations on proposed projects before work begins.
