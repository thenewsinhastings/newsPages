The Hastings Borough Council is set to review its planning policy in an effort to address the growing concerns over housing and development within the town. At a council meeting scheduled for this Thursday, councillors will discuss proposals that aim to streamline the planning process while ensuring environmental considerations are prioritised.

These proposed changes come after months of consultation with local residents and businesses who have voiced their opinions on how best to manage growth in Hastings without compromising its unique character and heritage sites. The discussions are expected to cover topics such as green belt protection, affordable housing initiatives, and the integration of renewable energy infrastructure into new developments.

Councillors will also take into account recommendations from a recent report by the Planning Advisory Service, which highlights best practices for sustainable urban development. Local MP Steve Reed has expressed his support for the initiative but stressed the importance of balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship.

If approved, these amendments could significantly influence future development projects within Hastings and Rye, shaping the towns' landscape for years to come.
