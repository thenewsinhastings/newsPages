Residents of Hastings and Rye gathered in the picturesque seaside town on Sunday to participate in the annual charity fun run, raising funds for local children's hospice care. Over 500 runners took part in the event, which saw participants of all ages completing a scenic route through the towns' historic streets and along the seafront.

The event was organized by the Hastings and Rye Community Association (HARCA) to raise awareness and funds for the local children's hospice that provides vital support to families dealing with childhood illnesses. Local businesses also showed their support, sponsoring various activities and providing refreshments at the finish line.

According to Sarah Jenkins, Chief Reporter of the Hastings & Rye Gazette, 'This year's fun run was a tremendous success, not only in terms of funds raised but also as a community-building event that brought together people from all walks of life. The atmosphere was electric, and everyone involved played an important role in making it such a memorable day.'

All proceeds will go directly to the local children's hospice, ensuring they can continue their mission of providing care and comfort to families who need them most.
