The Hastings & Rye Council has unveiled plans to launch a new initiative aimed at addressing the local housing crisis by increasing affordable housing options. The proposal, which will be put forward for public consultation in the coming weeks, includes the development of several hundred new homes priced at levels that are accessible to low and middle-income residents.

Council leader Jane Evans stated during Tuesday’s council meeting: 'This is a crucial step towards ensuring our community remains inclusive and vibrant. We recognize the urgent need to provide housing options for everyone who calls Hastings & Rye home.'

The initiative also includes measures to preserve existing affordable homes, as well as strategies to encourage private developers to include more affordable units in their projects.

Residents are encouraged to attend the upcoming public consultation sessions and contribute their views on how best to meet the needs of all local residents. Further details about participation will be announced shortly.
