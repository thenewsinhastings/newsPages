The Hastings and Rye Council has unveiled a set of proposals aimed at enhancing coastal resilience within the region. The measures, which are currently under review by local councillors, include plans to invest in sea defence infrastructure, improve drainage systems, and develop emergency response protocols for severe weather events.

Council members argue that these initiatives are crucial given the increasing frequency and intensity of storms impacting the Hastings and Rye coastline. The proposal also includes provisions for public consultation to gather feedback from residents on how best to protect their communities against future climate risks.

Environmentalist groups have praised the council's proactive stance but have called for a more robust commitment to sustainable coastal management practices that go beyond immediate defence strategies.

Residents are encouraged to attend upcoming public meetings scheduled across Hastings and Rye where they can discuss these proposals further with local councillors and contribute their insights.
