The local Reform UK party faces a police investigation after distributing letters under the guise of 'concerned neighbours' without including legally mandated information about the funding source. The controversy has sparked discussions around election law compliance and transparency within Hastings and Rye’s political community.

According to sources, these letters were sent in the Gorton and Denton constituencies ahead of a by-election. The omission of required imprints identifying Reform UK as the financial backer of the campaign materials is now under scrutiny by local authorities. This development highlights ongoing concerns about the integrity and adherence to regulations within political campaigning across Hastings and Rye.

As the inquiry progresses, local politicians are calling for stricter enforcement of election laws to ensure fair practices during electoral periods. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of transparency in democratic processes.
