The Hastings and Rye Council has recently approved new zoning laws aimed at promoting local development while maintaining the character of our communities. The decision was made following months of public consultation and debate among council members.

The new regulations are designed to encourage more mixed-use developments, which will help create more spaces for both residential and commercial use within the town centres. This move is expected to stimulate economic growth by attracting businesses while also addressing housing needs.

However, concerns have been raised about potential impacts on green spaces and historic buildings. Environmental groups have urged the council to ensure that these new developments do not compromise the sustainability of our towns or lead to unnecessary demolition of heritage sites.

The council has pledged to work closely with developers to implement strict guidelines that safeguard local landmarks and protect natural environments. Mayor Emma Green said, 'Our goal is to create a balanced approach that respects the unique qualities of Hastings and Rye while supporting economic progress.'

Community meetings are planned for next month where residents can voice their opinions on how these new regulations will be implemented in their neighborhoods.
