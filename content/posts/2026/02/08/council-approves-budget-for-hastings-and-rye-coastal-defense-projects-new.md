The Hastings & Rye Council has unanimously approved a budget proposal aimed at enhancing coastal defense infrastructure in the area. The project, which includes the construction of new sea walls and reinforcement of existing defenses, is expected to cost approximately £15 million over the next five years.

Council leader David Evans said that the decision was driven by recent severe weather events along the coast, emphasizing the importance of long-term planning to protect local communities from future climate risks. 'We cannot underestimate the threat posed by rising sea levels and more frequent storm surges,' he noted in a press statement.

Local residents gathered at public consultations expressed mixed views on the proposal, with many praising the initiative for its proactive approach but also raising concerns about potential disruptions during construction phases. Environmental groups have welcomed the council's commitment to resilient coastal development, calling it a step forward in adapting to climate change impacts.

The budget will also allocate funds towards community engagement programs designed to keep local residents informed and involved throughout the project duration. These efforts aim to ensure that all voices are heard and that any negative impacts on daily life are minimized as much as possible.
