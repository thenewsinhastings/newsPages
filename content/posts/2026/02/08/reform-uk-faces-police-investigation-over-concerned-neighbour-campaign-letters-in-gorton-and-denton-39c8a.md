In a significant development for local politics, Reform UK is set to face a police investigation following the distribution of letters purportedly written by 'concerned neighbours' in Gorton and Denton. The missives did not disclose their party funding and were sent out with the intent to disrupt an upcoming by-election.

The matter has raised eyebrows among Hastings and Rye residents, who are closely monitoring similar political tactics within our own community. Local politicians have expressed concern over the implications for fair elections and transparency in campaign practices.

As Reform UK prepares for potential scrutiny from law enforcement, local authorities in Hastings and Rye emphasize the importance of adhering to electoral laws to maintain public trust and ensure a level playing field during election periods.
