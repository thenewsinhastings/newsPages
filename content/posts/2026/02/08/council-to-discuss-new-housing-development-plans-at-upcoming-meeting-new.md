The Hastings and Rye Borough Council will hold a special meeting next week to discuss plans for a new housing development on the outskirts of Hastings. The proposed project, which has generated significant interest among residents and stakeholders alike, aims to provide over 200 new homes catering to various demographics including families and first-time buyers.

During the upcoming council meeting, members will review detailed proposals outlining the scope and impact of the development. Environmental concerns, traffic management, and affordable housing commitments are expected to be key points of discussion.

Council officials have stated that public consultation has been a crucial part of the planning process, with numerous feedback sessions held across both Hastings and Rye areas over the past few months. The council is committed to ensuring that any new development aligns with the broader objectives set out in the local area plan.

Local residents are encouraged to attend the meeting or submit written comments ahead of time to contribute their views on this significant initiative.
