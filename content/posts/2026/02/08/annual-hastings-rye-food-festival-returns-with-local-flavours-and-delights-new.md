The annual Hastings & Rye Food Festival is set to return this weekend, bringing together local food producers and enthusiasts for a celebration of regional cuisine. The event, now in its fifth year, promises to showcase the best of what our community has to offer in terms of culinary arts.

Organisers are expecting over 10,000 visitors to enjoy live cooking demonstrations, tastings from local artisans, and unique products that highlight the rich agricultural heritage of East Sussex. Local businesses will have a strong presence at the festival, with many offering exclusive deals for attendees.

Mayor Sarah Thompson expressed her enthusiasm for this year's event: 'The Hastings & Rye Food Festival is not just about food; it’s about community spirit and supporting local enterprise. We encourage everyone to come out and support our fantastic producers.'
