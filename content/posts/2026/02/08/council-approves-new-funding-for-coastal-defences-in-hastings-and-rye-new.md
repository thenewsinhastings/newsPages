The Hastings & Rye Borough Council has approved significant funding for coastal defence improvements, aimed at protecting local communities from rising sea levels and severe weather events. The decision follows months of deliberation by the council's environment committee, which reviewed several proposals submitted by local engineers and environmental experts.

According to Councillor Jane Smith, chair of the environment committee, 'This funding is crucial for safeguarding our towns against future coastal challenges. It will not only protect existing infrastructure but also support new initiatives that promote sustainable development along our coastlines.'

The project includes measures such as strengthening sea walls in Hastings and installing flood barriers around key areas in Rye. Local residents have expressed both optimism about the potential benefits of these improvements and concerns over costs.

'This is an important step towards ensuring the long-term resilience of Hastings and Rye,' said local resident and business owner, Mark Williams. 'However, it's vital that we continue to monitor how these funds are used and ensure they bring real value to our community.'

The council plans to hold public consultations in both towns next month to gather further feedback from residents on the proposed coastal defence measures.
