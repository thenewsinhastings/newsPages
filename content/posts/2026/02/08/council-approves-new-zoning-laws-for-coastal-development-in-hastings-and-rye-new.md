The Hastings & Rye Borough Council has approved new zoning laws aimed at regulating coastal development along the town's shoreline. The decision comes after months of debate among councillors and local residents, who have expressed mixed views on the potential impacts of increased construction in the area.

Supporters of the zoning changes argue that they will bring much-needed economic growth to Hastings and Rye while also protecting the unique character of the coastal region. Critics, however, fear that the new laws may lead to overdevelopment and loss of natural habitats along the coast.

The council's decision includes several key provisions: restrictions on building heights near heritage sites, requirements for green spaces in all new developments, and guidelines for waste management during construction. These measures are designed to balance environmental concerns with economic development goals.

Councilor Jane Thompson, who spoke at the meeting, highlighted the importance of these regulations: “We need to ensure that our coastline remains a cherished part of Hastings and Rye’s identity while also providing opportunities for growth. This compromise ensures we do just that.”

Local environmental groups have welcomed some aspects of the new laws but are calling for further protections, particularly concerning waste disposal and wildlife conservation areas.

The council will monitor compliance with these zoning changes closely over the next year to assess their effectiveness and make necessary adjustments.
