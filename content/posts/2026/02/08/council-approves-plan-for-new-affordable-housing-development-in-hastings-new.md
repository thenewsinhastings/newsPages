The Hastings & Rye Council has given the green light to a new affordable housing development project designed to address the growing need for budget-friendly homes within the local community. The proposed scheme aims to build over 100 new units on the site of an existing industrial area in Hastings, which is set to undergo significant regeneration.

Council members debated the merits and challenges associated with the project during a heated session last night, focusing primarily on how best to balance economic growth with maintaining affordable housing options for local residents. The decision was ultimately made after extensive public consultations and thorough reviews by various departments within the council.

Supporters of the plan argue that it will not only provide much-needed homes but also stimulate job creation and improve infrastructure in the area, contributing positively to Hastings' economy. However, some community members raised concerns about potential impacts on local traffic patterns and the environment during the initial public consultation phase.

Moving forward, developers are expected to begin preliminary groundwork within the next few weeks, with construction anticipated to start early next year pending further approvals from environmental authorities.
