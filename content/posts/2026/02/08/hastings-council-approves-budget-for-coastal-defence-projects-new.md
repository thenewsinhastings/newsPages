The Hastings Borough Council has approved a budget of £5 million to bolster coastal defence initiatives aimed at protecting the town from rising sea levels and severe weather events. The decision was made during last night's council meeting, where councillors also discussed plans for sustainable development along the coastline.

Council leader, Councillor Jane Smith, highlighted the importance of these measures in safeguarding local communities and businesses against future climate change impacts. She stated that the funds will be used to enhance existing sea walls, implement beach nourishment projects, and explore innovative solutions such as green infrastructure like saltmarshes and dunes.

The decision follows extensive consultations with environmental experts, residents' groups, and other stakeholders over recent months. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, reflecting the widespread recognition of the urgent need for action on coastal resilience.

Local MP, Mr. Alan Harris, commended the council's proactive approach but also urged for greater federal support to ensure long-term sustainability of these projects. He noted that while Hastings is making commendable efforts, the scale and urgency of climate change challenges require collaborative national strategies alongside local initiatives.

Residents are encouraged to attend upcoming public meetings where further details about specific projects will be discussed. For more information or to get involved in community planning sessions, please visit the council's website or contact your ward councillor directly.
