The Hastings & Rye Council has given the green light to a significant infrastructure project aimed at improving the facilities and sustainability of Hastings Harbour. The initiative, which includes upgrades to the harbour's berthing space and the installation of renewable energy systems, is expected to boost local tourism and enhance maritime safety.

Council members debated extensively on the investment required for the project, with some arguing that it would stimulate economic growth by attracting more visitors to Hastings and Rye. Others raised concerns about potential environmental impacts and called for stringent monitoring measures.

Mayor Jane Smith highlighted that this development aligns closely with the council's broader strategy to promote sustainable tourism and support local businesses.

Residents are encouraged to participate in upcoming public consultations, where they can provide feedback on specific aspects of the project.
