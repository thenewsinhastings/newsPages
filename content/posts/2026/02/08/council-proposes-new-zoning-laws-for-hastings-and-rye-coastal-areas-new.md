The Hastings Borough Council is set to propose new zoning laws aimed at regulating coastal development in both Hastings and Rye. The proposed changes will address concerns over rising sea levels, protecting natural habitats, and ensuring sustainable growth along the coastline.

At a council meeting scheduled for next week, councillors will discuss amendments to existing planning regulations that would restrict building activities near vulnerable areas of the coast. Local residents have been invited to provide feedback on the proposals ahead of their formal adoption.

Environmental campaigners have welcomed the initiative, highlighting the need for stricter controls as coastal communities face increasing threats from climate change. However, some local business owners are concerned about potential impacts on tourism and development opportunities.

Councillors acknowledge the complexity of balancing environmental protection with economic interests but emphasize the importance of long-term sustainability. Public consultations will take place over the coming months to gather further input from stakeholders.
