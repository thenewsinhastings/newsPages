In a heartening display of local solidarity, the annual Hastings and Rye Charity Run took place on Sunday morning. The event, now in its fifth year, saw over 500 participants from both towns gather at the Hastings Seafront for the sunrise start.

Organized by the Hastings Community Foundation, the run aims to raise funds for underprivileged youth programs in the area. This year's event has already surpassed last year's fundraising target of £3,000 by a significant margin due to generous donations and enthusiastic participation from both runners and sponsors.

Mayor of Hastings, Councillor Angela Roberts, congratulated the organizers and participants, emphasizing the importance of community initiatives such as this. She highlighted how events like these not only foster a sense of unity among residents but also make a tangible difference in local lives.

Participants included individuals from various age groups, with many schools sending teams to support their students' efforts. The event featured live music and refreshments at the finish line on Rye Harbour, adding to the festive atmosphere.

For those who missed out this year, organizers are already planning ahead for next year's run, aiming to build upon its success and continue supporting local youth development projects.
