The council of Hastings and Rye has unanimously approved a budget proposal aimed at enhancing the coastal defences in both towns. The move is seen as crucial given recent severe weather events that have highlighted vulnerabilities along the coastline.

"This funding allocation is vital for the long-term security and sustainability of our local communities," said Councillor Laura Wilson, leader of Hastings Borough Council. "It will allow us to implement urgent upgrades and begin planning larger-scale projects needed to protect against future coastal threats." 

The budget includes £5 million allocated towards immediate repair works and another £20 million reserved for extensive renovations and improvements over the next five years.

Residents are encouraged to attend public information sessions scheduled throughout March, where they can learn more about planned initiatives and discuss concerns with local authorities. The council also invites feedback from all stakeholders to ensure the best possible outcomes for Hastings and Rye residents.
