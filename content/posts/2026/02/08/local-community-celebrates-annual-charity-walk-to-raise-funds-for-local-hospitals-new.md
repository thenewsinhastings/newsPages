On a bright and sunny morning in Hastings & Rye, hundreds of local residents gathered at the town hall square for the annual charity walk. Organized by the Hastings & Rye Health Foundation, the event aimed to raise funds and awareness for the local hospitals.

Participants included community members, families, and healthcare workers from both towns who walked through various scenic routes in support of the cause. The walk covered a distance of five miles and concluded at the park where refreshments were provided by local businesses.

The charity event was a resounding success, with over £10,000 raised so far. Organisers have expressed their gratitude to all who participated and donated, stating that the funds will be crucial in supporting the ongoing needs of Hastings & Rye hospitals.

Community leaders praised the initiative for bringing people together and fostering a sense of community spirit. Mayor Mary Evans stated, “Events like this remind us how much we value our local healthcare providers and their tireless work.”

The Hastings & Rye Health Foundation will continue to update participants on how the funds are being used to improve health services in the region.
