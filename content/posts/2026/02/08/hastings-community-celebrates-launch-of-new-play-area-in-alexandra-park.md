Local residents gathered yesterday to celebrate the opening of a brand new play area at Alexandra Park in Hastings. The event was organised by Hastings Borough Council, which invested £50,000 into the project as part of its ongoing commitment to enhance recreational facilities for families and young people.

The newly constructed playground features a variety of exciting equipment suitable for children of all ages, including climbing frames, swings, and interactive games. Local parents praised the initiative, highlighting how it provides much-needed space for their children to play safely while also encouraging community interaction.

Councillor Jane Thompson, who spoke at the opening ceremony, expressed her delight in seeing the project come to fruition after years of planning. She encouraged all residents to make full use of this new resource and thanked volunteers from Hastings Friends of Parks group for their invaluable support during construction.

The playground is expected to attract visitors not just from Hastings but also neighbouring towns such as Rye, further boosting tourism in the area.
