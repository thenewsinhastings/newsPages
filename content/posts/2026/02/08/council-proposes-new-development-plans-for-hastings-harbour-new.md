The Hastings Borough Council has recently proposed new development plans aimed at revitalising Hastings Harbour. The proposals include the construction of a new pier, additional parking facilities, and improved public amenities to attract more tourists and enhance local businesses.

During a council meeting last week, councillors discussed the potential economic benefits as well as the environmental considerations that come with such ambitious projects. Residents are encouraged to provide feedback on the plans through an online survey, which will be open until mid-December.

The proposals have been met with mixed reactions from local residents and businesses, highlighting the importance of community engagement in shaping the future of Hastings Harbour.
