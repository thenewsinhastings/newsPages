Local community groups in Hastings and Rye joined forces yesterday to host the annual charity run, an event that has grown significantly over the years. Hundreds of participants took part in this year's race, which started at All Saints' Church in Rye and concluded on the picturesque seafront promenade in Hastings.

The event raised a substantial amount for local charities focusing on youth empowerment and environmental conservation. Organisers praised the community spirit exhibited by both runners and volunteers alike, highlighting the positive impact such initiatives have on fostering stronger community bonds.

With sponsorship from several local businesses, including The Rye Bookshop and Hastings Coffee Roasters, this year's event was a significant success in terms of both participation and fundraising. Proceeds will be distributed among selected charities that work closely with the needs of Hastings and Rye residents.
