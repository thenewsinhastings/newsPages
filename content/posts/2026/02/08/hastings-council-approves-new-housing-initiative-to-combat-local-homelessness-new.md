The Hastings Borough Council has approved a new initiative aimed at addressing the growing issue of homelessness within the local community. The plan includes the development of affordable housing units and support services for those in need.

During last week's council meeting, councillors debated the proposal extensively, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities presented by such an ambitious project. Mayor Jane Smith emphasized that this initiative is a crucial step towards providing stable living conditions for vulnerable residents in Hastings and Rye.

The new housing scheme will see the construction of 50 additional homes over the next two years, specifically designed to cater to low-income families and individuals experiencing homelessness. Additionally, the council has pledged to allocate funds for ongoing support services including employment assistance and mental health resources.

Local activists and charities have welcomed the news as a positive move towards tackling one of Hastings' most pressing social issues. However, some councillors are concerned about the potential financial burden on taxpayers and the speed at which the project can be implemented effectively.

The council is currently seeking public input through a series of town hall meetings scheduled for next month in both Hastings and Rye.
