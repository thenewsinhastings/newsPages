A local charity has launched a winter appeal aimed at providing essential support to vulnerable residents in Hastings and Rye. The initiative, which includes the distribution of warm clothing, food parcels, and fuel vouchers, aims to combat the increasing challenges faced by those struggling financially during colder months.

The charity's spokesperson expressed concern over rising energy prices and their impact on low-income families, urging local businesses and community members to contribute generously to the cause. The appeal will run throughout winter, with collection points set up across Hastings and Rye for donations of clothing, food, and financial contributions.

Community leaders have praised the charity's efforts and are encouraging residents to reach out if they know someone who might benefit from this assistance. For more information on how to contribute or to seek help, visit the charity’s website or contact their local office.
