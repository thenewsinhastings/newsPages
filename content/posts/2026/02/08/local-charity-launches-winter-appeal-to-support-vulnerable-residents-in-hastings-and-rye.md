The Hastings and Rye Community Support Network (CSCN) has launched its annual winter appeal, aimed at providing essential support to vulnerable residents in the area. The initiative seeks to raise funds for heating bills, food parcels, and other necessities that can become critical as temperatures drop.

“With the colder months approaching, it’s crucial we ensure no one feels isolated or struggles without basic needs,” said Jane Thompson, Director of CSCN. “Our goal is to extend a helping hand to those who may face financial hardships during this period.”

The appeal will run throughout the winter and includes community events, online donations, and partnerships with local businesses to amplify their reach.

Residents interested in supporting the campaign can contribute by visiting the charity’s website or donating at one of the drop-off points located across Hastings and Rye.
