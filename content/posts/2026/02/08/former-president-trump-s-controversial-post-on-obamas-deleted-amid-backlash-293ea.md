In a significant development at the national level, former President Donald Trump's controversial post regarding then-President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama has been removed from social media after facing widespread criticism. Despite earlier support from the White House for the remarks, the backlash prompted an immediate response.

While this incident primarily concerns national politics in Washington D.C., it resonates with local communities across Britain, including Hastings and Rye. The deletion of such content serves as a reminder of the impact social media can have on political discourse and public opinion.

Hastings & Rye residents who engage in discussions about national figures may find this development noteworthy. It highlights the importance of respectful dialogue and the potential consequences of controversial statements, especially when made by high-profile individuals.
