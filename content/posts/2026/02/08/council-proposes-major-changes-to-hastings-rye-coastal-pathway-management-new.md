The Hastings and Rye Borough Council has announced plans for significant reforms in the management of local coastal pathways, a move aimed at improving both safety and accessibility for residents and visitors alike.

The proposed changes include the introduction of enhanced lighting along key stretches of the pathway during evening hours to ensure visibility and reduce accidents. Additionally, there are discussions about integrating more frequent maintenance schedules to address erosion issues promptly, ensuring that these natural landmarks remain safe and enjoyable for all users.

Councillor Jane Smith, who is responsible for environmental affairs, highlighted the importance of community engagement in this process. She stated: “We have been consulting with local residents and stakeholders extensively over recent months, and their feedback has played a crucial role in shaping our proposals.”

The council will hold public consultations in both Hastings and Rye next month to gather further input from the community before finalising the plans.

Environmental campaigners have broadly welcomed these initiatives but also raised concerns about potential cost implications and long-term sustainability. They urge for transparency regarding funding sources and commitment to environmental protection during construction phases.
