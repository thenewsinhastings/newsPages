The annual Hastings and Rye Community Festival is gearing up for another year of celebrating the rich heritage and community spirit that defines our region. Scheduled to take place in August, the event will feature a range of activities including live music performances, traditional crafts demonstrations, and food stalls offering local cuisine.

Organisers are excited about this year's theme, which focuses on unity and the diverse cultural backgrounds that contribute to the unique identity of Hastings and Rye. Local schools have also been invited to participate in the festival by showcasing their talents through dance and drama performances.

Mayor of Hastings & Rye Council, Councillor Jane Evans, praised the ongoing efforts from volunteers who dedicate their time each year to ensure the success of the event. She noted that such festivals play a crucial role in strengthening community bonds and fostering a sense of pride within residents.

For those looking to get involved or support this year’s festival, organisers have announced various volunteer opportunities available online through the official website.
