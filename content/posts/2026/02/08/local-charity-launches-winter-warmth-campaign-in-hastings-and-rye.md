In a bid to support vulnerable residents during the harsh winter months, local charity 'Warm Hearts' has launched its annual Winter Warmth campaign. The initiative aims to provide heating and energy assistance to those in need within Hastings and Rye.

Speaking at the launch event held yesterday evening, CEO Jane Thompson expressed her gratitude towards community members for their continued support: “Every contribution helps us ensure that no one goes cold this winter. We are incredibly thankful for all the volunteers who have come forward.”

The charity is also inviting local businesses to participate by donating funds or hosting fundraising events. For more information on how you can contribute, visit the Warm Hearts website at www.warmhearts.org.uk.
