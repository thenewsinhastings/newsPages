The Hastings Borough Council has approved a new development plan aimed at revitalising the historic harbour area. The plan includes proposals to improve infrastructure, increase tourism opportunities, and create more job openings in the region.

Speaking at today’s council meeting, Councillor Sarah Green stated that the initiative is crucial for the economic growth of both Hastings and Rye. She highlighted that the project will also focus on preserving the area's rich heritage while enhancing its appeal to visitors and residents alike.

Opponents of the plan have raised concerns about potential environmental impacts and the displacement of local businesses. However, council officials assure that all necessary measures are being taken to address these issues effectively.

The development is expected to proceed with public consultations scheduled for next month, allowing citizens to contribute their views on the proposed changes.
