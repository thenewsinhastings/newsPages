Last night saw the bustling town of Hastings come together for a remarkable evening at the annual charity gala, celebrating local heroes who have made significant contributions to the community throughout the year. The event, held at the prestigious Hastings Town Hall, was attended by over 300 guests, including community leaders, volunteers, and beneficiaries of various local initiatives.

The night began with speeches from Mayor Jane Foster and Deputy Mayor David Taylor, who paid tribute to the unsung heroes whose hard work goes unnoticed but makes a significant difference in people’s lives. Among the honorees were members of the Hastings Youth Club, who received special recognition for their dedication to supporting young individuals.

In addition to the awards ceremony, attendees enjoyed a splendid buffet and an array of live performances by local artists. The gala also featured a silent auction where proceeds will be split between several local charities, ensuring that every guest left with a sense of fulfillment knowing they had contributed to making Hastings a better place for everyone.

This year’s event was particularly special as it marked the 10th anniversary of the charity gala, reflecting on a decade of community support and achievements. As the night concluded, organizers expressed their gratitude towards all who participated in making this year's event a success and look forward to continuing the tradition next year with renewed vigor.
