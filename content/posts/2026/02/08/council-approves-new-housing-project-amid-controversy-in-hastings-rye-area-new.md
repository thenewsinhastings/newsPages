The Hastings and Rye Council has approved a controversial new housing project that aims to provide affordable homes for local residents. The plan, which includes the construction of 500 new units in the heart of Hastings, has been met with mixed reactions from community members.

Supporters argue that the development will help address the area's ongoing housing crisis by providing much-needed affordable accommodation. Critics, however, express concerns over potential impacts on local infrastructure and green spaces.

During the council meeting, a heated debate ensued as councillors were divided in their opinions about the project's merits. Mayor Jane Smith defended the decision, stating that 'the needs of our community take precedence over all other considerations.'

Local activists have vowed to continue campaigning against what they see as an unnecessary encroachment on natural habitats and an undue burden on local services. They plan to file a formal objection with environmental agencies in the coming weeks.

The council's decision will be closely watched by residents and developers alike, who are waiting to see how this project unfolds over the next few months.
