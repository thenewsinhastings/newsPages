The annual Hastings and Rye Arts Festival returned this weekend, bringing together local artists, performers, and visitors for a week of cultural events. The festival, which has been running since the early 1980s, is one of the most anticipated community activities in the region.

With over 20 venues hosting more than 50 shows, the event showcases everything from theatre to music performances and visual arts exhibitions. This year’s theme focuses on celebrating diversity within the local artistic scene, with a special spotlight on emerging talent.

The festival also includes workshops for children and adults, offering an opportunity for community members of all ages to engage in creative activities and learn new skills. Local businesses have shown strong support by hosting events and providing spaces for exhibitions.

Organisers expressed their gratitude towards the sponsors and volunteers who made this year’s edition possible, stressing the importance of continued local involvement for future success. As the festival draws to a close, plans are already underway for next year, with organisers looking forward to another exciting celebration of arts in Hastings and Rye.
