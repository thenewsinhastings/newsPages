The Hastings Council has announced a review of local business tax incentives aimed at stimulating economic growth in the region. The initiative, which follows a period of financial uncertainty due to recent market fluctuations, seeks to attract and retain businesses by offering tailored support packages for start-ups and established enterprises alike.

Councillor Sarah Williams, responsible for economic development, stated that 'the council is committed to fostering an environment where local businesses can thrive. We are looking at ways to reduce the burden of taxation on our smaller business owners while also providing incentives for larger firms to invest in Hastings.'

The review will include consultations with various stakeholders including local entrepreneurs and financial experts to ensure that any new measures introduced align with the needs of the community.

Residents and businesses interested in contributing to this important discussion are encouraged to attend upcoming public meetings or provide feedback through the council's official website.
