A new community group has emerged to tackle the growing issue of waste management in Hastings and Rye. The 'Green Guardians' have launched a recycling initiative aimed at educating residents on proper disposal methods and encouraging more sustainable practices.

The group, consisting of local volunteers passionate about environmental issues, is setting up collection points across both towns where citizens can drop off recyclable materials that are not part of the regular waste service. This move comes in response to an increasing amount of non-recyclables being mixed with other waste due to lack of clear guidance and facilities.

'Our goal is to raise awareness about the importance of recycling correctly,' says Sarah Thompson, a founding member of Green Guardians. 'We are working closely with local authorities to ensure that these efforts complement their existing programs and contribute positively towards our community’s environmental goals.'

Residents interested in supporting or learning more about this initiative can attend an information session at the Rye Library on Saturday, where members will be available to discuss their plans for expansion and how everyone can get involved.

For those unable to make it to the event, details about upcoming activities and volunteer opportunities are also available online via the Green Guardians’ official website.
