The Hastings Borough Council is set to debate significant funding proposals aimed at bolstering coastal defence infrastructure. The agenda includes a detailed report on the necessary investments to protect local properties and amenities from rising sea levels and severe weather events.

Council members are expected to discuss various options, ranging from immediate short-term measures such as sandbag distribution and emergency response protocols, to long-term projects like constructing new seawalls and reinforcing existing structures. The proposals also include plans for community engagement initiatives aimed at educating residents on the importance of coastal protection efforts and encouraging participation in local beach clean-up activities.

The meeting will take place this Thursday at 2 PM at Hastings Town Hall. Members of the public are invited to attend and provide their input during a designated consultation period. For those unable to attend, the council has announced that feedback can be submitted via email or through an online survey available on the council’s official website.

According to Councillor Linda Green, who is leading the initiative, the aim of these proposals is not only to safeguard Hastings from potential future threats but also to enhance the town's resilience and adaptability in the face of climate change. She emphasized that community involvement will be crucial in ensuring the success of any proposed projects.

For more information or to submit feedback, interested residents can contact the council directly or visit the dedicated webpage on the council’s website.
