The Hastings and Rye Council is set to introduce a new planning policy aimed at addressing the ongoing housing crisis in the area. The proposal, which will be discussed during an upcoming council meeting, aims to streamline the process for building affordable homes while maintaining the unique character of both towns.

Council leaders argue that the current system has been too slow and cumbersome, preventing much-needed developments from taking place. They propose a more flexible approach to planning rules, which would allow developers greater freedom within certain guidelines designed to protect local heritage and green spaces.

The proposal comes after months of consultation with residents and stakeholders who have expressed growing concern about the lack of affordable housing options in Hastings and Rye. While some have welcomed the initiative as a step towards solving the crisis, others fear it could lead to overdevelopment and loss of local character.

Council leader Jane Smith said: 'We understand the urgent need for more homes but also recognise our responsibility to preserve what makes Hastings and Rye special. Our goal is to strike a balance between these two priorities.'

The council will be seeking further public feedback on the proposed changes before making any final decisions, ensuring that local voices are heard in shaping the area's future.
