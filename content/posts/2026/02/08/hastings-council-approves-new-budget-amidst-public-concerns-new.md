In a closely watched meeting yesterday, Hastings Town Council approved its budget for the upcoming financial year. The decision follows months of public consultations and debates over funding priorities within the community.

The new budget includes significant investments in local infrastructure projects such as road repairs and improvements to public parks, reflecting citizen concerns expressed during recent town hall meetings. However, it also involves cuts to certain services, including a reduction in arts funding, which has sparked controversy among cultural groups in both Hastings and Rye.

Councillor Alan Green, the council’s finance spokesman, defended the budget plan as necessary for maintaining essential public services while addressing urgent infrastructure needs. He highlighted that the proposed changes aim to secure long-term financial stability for the area without compromising on critical local initiatives.

Local residents have expressed mixed reactions, with some praising the emphasis on practical improvements and others voicing concerns over potential impacts on community cohesion through reduced support for cultural activities.

As Hastings and Rye continue to navigate economic challenges alongside growing population demands, the approved budget sets a direction that promises both opportunities and challenges ahead. The council will now work closely with local stakeholders to implement these changes effectively.
