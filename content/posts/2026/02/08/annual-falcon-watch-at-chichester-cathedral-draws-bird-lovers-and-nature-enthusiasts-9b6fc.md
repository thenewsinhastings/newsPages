HASTINGS & RYE - For the past quarter-century, nature enthusiasts in Hastings and Rye have been eagerly awaiting the annual return of peregrine falcons to their iconic nesting site on the spire of Chichester Cathedral. This year marks a significant milestone as the birds celebrate their 25th consecutive year at this West Sussex landmark.

The event has become a beloved tradition for bird watchers and local residents alike, who gather around live streams to observe the falcons during their nesting period. The annual spectacle not only highlights the importance of conservation efforts but also underscores the rich biodiversity that exists within our region's natural heritage.

Local groups such as the Hastings & Rye Wildlife Trust have played a crucial role in supporting these initiatives by providing educational resources and public engagement programmes aimed at raising awareness about wildlife preservation.

As we continue to celebrate this remarkable chapter, the community stands united in its commitment to protecting local habitats and ensuring that future generations can enjoy similar wonders of nature.
