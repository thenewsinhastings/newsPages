The Hastings and Rye Borough Council has approved a new planning policy aimed at protecting coastal areas from the impacts of climate change while promoting sustainable development. The policy, which was discussed at last night's council meeting, includes measures to enhance sea defenses, manage flooding risks, and support the creation of green spaces along the coast.

Councillor Sarah Thompson, the lead on environmental issues for the council, stated that 'this is a significant step forward in ensuring our coastal communities are resilient to future challenges while preserving their unique character and beauty.' The new policy also includes provisions for stricter building regulations near the coastline to prevent unnecessary construction in vulnerable areas.

Local residents were present at the meeting, expressing mixed opinions about the changes. Some praised the council's initiative as a necessary safeguard against rising sea levels and storm surges, while others raised concerns over potential restrictions on property development rights. The policy will now be reviewed by an independent panel before it is formally adopted in early spring.

Further details and public consultations are scheduled to take place in the coming months as part of a broader engagement strategy with residents and stakeholders.
