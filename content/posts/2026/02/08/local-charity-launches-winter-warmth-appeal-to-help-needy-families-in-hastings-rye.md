The local charity, Hope for Hastings and Rye (HH&R), has announced the launch of its annual 'Winter Warmth' appeal. This initiative aims to provide financial support and essential items such as heating oil, winter clothing, and food to vulnerable families struggling during the colder months.

Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, HH&R's CEO, Jane Thompson, said: “With fuel prices soaring and economic pressures increasing, it is more crucial than ever that we come together as a community to ensure no one goes without warmth or sustenance this winter. We are urging residents of Hastings and Rye to donate generously.”

The charity has set up collection points across both towns where people can drop off contributions. Additionally, monetary donations can be made through the HH&R website.
