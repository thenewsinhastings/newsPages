In a significant move towards protecting Hastings' coastal heritage and infrastructure, the local council has unanimously agreed to increase funding allocated to coastal defences. The decision comes after months of consultation with environmental experts and community representatives concerned about rising sea levels and increased storm activity along the coast.

Council Leader Peter Green said: 'This is an investment in our future. Our coastline is a precious asset, not just for its natural beauty but also as a major economic driver through tourism.' The additional funds will be used to reinforce existing sea walls and implement new projects designed to mitigate flooding risks.

Local residents have expressed mixed feelings about the development; while many welcome the investment in protecting their homes and businesses, others are concerned about potential disruptions during construction. Environmental advocates like Dr Alan Mercer have praised the decision, highlighting its importance for long-term sustainability.

The council’s next steps include engaging with local contractors to begin immediate planning phases and setting a timeline for implementation.
