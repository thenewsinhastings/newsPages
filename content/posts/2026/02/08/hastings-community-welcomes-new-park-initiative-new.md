The Hastings community is abuzz with excitement as the local council announces plans for a new park initiative aimed at enhancing public spaces in both Hastings and Rye. The project, set to begin early next year, includes improvements such as playground installations, additional green space, and new walking paths.

Speaking at a recent town hall meeting, Councillor Laura Green said, “This is an exciting time for our community. We are committed to creating more enjoyable spaces where residents of all ages can come together.”

The initiative has received widespread support from local residents who see it as a step towards better community engagement and healthier lifestyles. Local businesses have also shown interest in the project, recognizing its potential to attract more visitors and enhance the quality of life for those living nearby.
