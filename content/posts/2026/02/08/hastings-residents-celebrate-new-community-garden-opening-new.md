Residents of Hastings and Rye gathered today to celebrate the opening of a new community garden in the heart of Hastings. The project, which has been in development for over two years, aims to provide local residents with a green space where they can come together to grow vegetables, flowers, and herbs.

Speaking at the event, Mayor Jane Smith praised the dedication of volunteers who have worked tirelessly to bring this vision to life. 'This garden is not just about growing plants,' she said, 'it's about fostering community spirit and encouraging people to engage with their local environment.'

The garden features a variety of sections including raised beds for those with mobility issues, an area dedicated to children’s educational activities, and communal seating areas where residents can meet and share ideas. Plans are also in place to host regular workshops on sustainable gardening practices.

Local councillor Mark Evans highlighted the importance of such initiatives for enhancing community well-being: 'With increasing pressures on our urban spaces, projects like this one remind us that small actions can have a big impact.'

The garden is open daily from dawn until dusk and all are welcome to visit or volunteer. For more information about how you can get involved, contact the local council's environmental team.
