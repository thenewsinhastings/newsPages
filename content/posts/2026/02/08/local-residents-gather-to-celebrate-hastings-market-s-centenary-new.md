Residents and visitors alike gathered in Hastings town centre on Saturday to celebrate the centenary of the historic Hastings Market. The event, organised by the local council in collaboration with market traders, offered a day filled with traditional crafts, live music performances, and food stalls showcasing the best of Hastings cuisine.

Speaking at the opening ceremony, Councillor Sarah Lee said, 'The Hastings Market has been an integral part of our community for over 100 years. It serves not only as a hub for trade but also as a meeting point for friends and families.'

Visitors were treated to special performances by local school choirs and a surprise appearance from the Hastings Town Band, who played nostalgic tunes from the market's early days.

The celebration was attended by hundreds of people, many dressed in period costumes to reflect the market’s rich history. The day concluded with a lantern parade through the town, symbolising the light that this landmark continues to bring to the community.
