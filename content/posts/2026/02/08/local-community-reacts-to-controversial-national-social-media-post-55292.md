Late last night, a video posted on the social media account of former President Donald J. Trump sparked immediate debate across the country and has begun to resonate within our local communities in Hastings & Rye.

The post featured debunked claims about the 2020 presidential election accompanied by an image that was widely condemned for its racial undertones, showing former presidents Barack Obama and Michelle Obama with their heads attached to the bodies of apes. The content has been criticized for being misleading and inappropriate by numerous fact-checking organisations.

While this issue primarily stems from national politics, it has caused local residents to reflect on the role social media plays in shaping public opinion within our community. Local leaders have expressed concern over the potential impact such divisive content might have on fostering a cohesive community environment.

The Hastings & Rye Police Department and other local authorities are reminding members of the public that sharing or creating racially insensitive materials can have legal consequences, including harassment and discrimination charges under local laws.

Community groups in both Hastings and Rye are planning meetings to discuss how they can support education on digital citizenship and media literacy among local residents. These initiatives aim to promote responsible social media use and encourage dialogue that respects diverse perspectives within the community.
