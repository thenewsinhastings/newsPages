Local residents and visitors are invited to take part in the upcoming coastal clean-up event aimed at enhancing the beauty of Hastings and Rye's coastline. Organised by the Coastal Care Group, the initiative seeks volunteers willing to help remove litter from beaches and improve water quality.

The event will be held on Saturday, 15th September, with check-in starting at 9:00 AM near Marine Court in Hastings. Participants are encouraged to wear suitable clothing for beach work and bring their own gloves if possible.

Coastal Care Group spokesperson, Karen Green, emphasised the importance of such activities for preserving local wildlife and ensuring that future generations can enjoy a cleaner marine environment. 'We hope this event will raise awareness about the impact of pollution on our coastlines and encourage more community involvement in environmental conservation,' said Ms. Green.

For those interested in joining or who wish to donate resources, contact details are available at the Coastal Care Group's website.
