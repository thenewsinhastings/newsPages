The local community of Hastings and Rye has come together to celebrate a significant milestone for the Coastal Care charity. Founded five years ago, Coastal Care has been providing support services for elderly residents in need within the area, offering companionship, meals on wheels, and regular check-ins to ensure their well-being.

Over 100 volunteers have joined forces this year to help mark the anniversary with a community picnic at Alexandra Park. The event featured live music, stalls from local businesses, and activities for all ages, aiming to raise awareness of the charity's work while also raising funds through donations and raffle tickets.

John Smith, who has been actively involved since Coastal Care’s inception, commented on the importance of such gatherings: 'It’s heartwarming to see how our community supports each other. The contributions from local residents have made a real difference in our ability to offer help where it's needed most.'

Coastal Care’s efforts do not go unnoticed by local councillors either; Councillor Jane Doe praised the charity for its dedication and impact: 'We are incredibly proud of what Coastal Care has achieved over these past five years. They have made a tangible difference in our community, especially in challenging times.'
