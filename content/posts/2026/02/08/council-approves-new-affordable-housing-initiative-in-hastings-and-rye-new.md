The Hastings Borough Council has given the green light to a new initiative aimed at increasing affordable housing options within the borough, focusing particularly on the towns of Hastings and Rye. The decision was made during a special council meeting last week where councillors discussed the pressing need for more accessible accommodation in the area.

According to Mayor Jane Smith, the plan includes setting aside land reserves that will be used specifically for constructing new homes aimed at low-income families and first-time buyers. Additionally, the initiative will see an increase in funding allocated towards social housing projects across both Hastings and Rye.

Local residents have been highly supportive of this move, with many expressing concerns about the rising cost of living in the area and the difficulty in finding affordable accommodation. The council hopes that by implementing these measures, they can help alleviate some of the pressure on local families while also boosting economic activity within the community.

However, there are those who have voiced reservations over potential challenges such as delays in construction projects or issues related to funding allocation. Councillor Mark Roberts acknowledged these concerns but stated that the council is committed to working closely with developers and stakeholders to ensure a smooth implementation of the project.

As part of this initiative, the council will also be partnering with local housing associations and charities to provide additional support services for residents moving into new homes or seeking help with securing affordable accommodation. This collaborative approach aims to create a more sustainable solution that benefits both current and future homeowners in Hastings and Rye.
