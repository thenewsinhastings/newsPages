The Hastings Borough Council has given the green light to a new affordable housing initiative aimed at addressing the pressing need for more accessible homes in both Hastings and Rye. The proposal, which was unanimously supported by councillors during yesterday's council meeting, includes plans to build over 100 new homes that will be rented out below market rates.

The initiative aims to provide much-needed relief to local residents who have struggled with rising housing costs and a lack of affordable options in the area. Council leader Rachel Smith highlighted the importance of this project during her address to councillors, stating, “This is a significant step forward in our commitment to ensuring that everyone in Hastings and Rye has access to secure and affordable accommodation.”

The new homes will be constructed across several sites within both towns, with construction expected to begin early next year. The council hopes this initiative will not only provide housing but also stimulate local economic growth through the creation of jobs during the building phase.

Local residents have expressed mixed reactions to the proposal, with some welcoming the news and others raising concerns about potential impacts on local infrastructure and services. Council officials assure that measures are in place to mitigate any adverse effects and ensure smooth integration of these new developments into existing communities.

For more information about this initiative and other council decisions affecting Hastings and Rye, residents can visit the official council website or attend upcoming public meetings.
