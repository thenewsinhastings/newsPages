The Hastings Borough Council has unanimously approved a new affordable housing initiative aimed at addressing the local shortage of affordable homes. The plan includes setting aside several plots of land for the construction of more than 50 new social and affordable housing units within the next two years.

The decision comes in response to increasing pressure from residents who have been facing challenges in finding accommodation due to rising property prices and limited supply. Council members emphasized the importance of ensuring that all community members, regardless of income level, can find suitable housing options within Hastings and Rye.

In addition to providing additional affordable homes, the initiative also includes measures to improve access to public services for those who will benefit from the new housing units. The council has pledged to work closely with local developers to ensure that all requirements are met in a timely fashion and to the highest standards possible.
