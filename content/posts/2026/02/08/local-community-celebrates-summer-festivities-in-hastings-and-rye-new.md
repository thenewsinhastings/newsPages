The sun shone brightly as the annual Summer Festival kicked off in both Hastings and Rye, bringing together residents and visitors alike for a day filled with music, food, and fun. The event, which has been a staple of local culture since its inception over two decades ago, featured live performances from local bands, artisanal crafts stalls, and a variety of delicious street foods.

In Hastings, the bustling atmosphere was palpable as people strolled through the town centre, exploring different market stalls and enjoying the music. Meanwhile, in Rye, families gathered in the picturesque cobbled streets to watch traditional Morris dancing performances and participate in children's activities such as face painting and balloon modelling.

The festival not only serves as a celebration of summer but also acts as a platform for local artists and businesses to showcase their work and connect with the community. Local vendors reported high sales, with many expressing gratitude towards the vibrant turnout.

Organizers highlighted the importance of these events in fostering community spirit and providing a sense of belonging among residents. They encouraged everyone to continue supporting such initiatives that bring Hastings and Rye closer together.
