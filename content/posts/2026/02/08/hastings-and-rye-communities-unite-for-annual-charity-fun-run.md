Residents of Hastings and Rye joined forces on Saturday to participate in the annual charity fun run, which aims to raise funds for local children's hospitals. Over 500 participants from all age groups took part in the event, with enthusiastic support from the community lining the streets along the route.

The event started at Victoria Gardens in Hastings and concluded at Rye Castle Museum, where prizes were awarded to top fundraisers. Organisers reported a significant increase in donations this year compared to previous years, reflecting the growing engagement of both towns in supporting local health initiatives.

Local business owners also played a key role by providing refreshments and sponsoring runners. The event not only raised funds but also fostered community spirit among participants and spectators alike.
