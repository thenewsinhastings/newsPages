Residents of Hastings and Rye joined forces last weekend for a successful coastal clean-up event, aimed at preserving the beauty and health of their local beaches. Organised by the Hastings and Rye Coastal Conservation Group (HRCG), over 150 volunteers turned out to collect litter and debris scattered along the shoreline.

The initiative is part of a wider campaign to raise awareness about marine pollution and encourage community engagement in environmental issues. Beaches such as Rock-a-Nore and Camber Sands saw significant improvements, with participants collecting more than two tonnes of waste during the event.

Local councillor Jane Thompson praised the efforts of all involved: “It’s heartening to see so many people from our communities coming together for a shared goal. This is what makes Hastings and Rye such special places.”

HRCG spokesperson, Mark Wilson, said, “We are thrilled with the outcome. The enthusiasm and dedication shown by everyone made this year's event even more impactful. We hope to continue making waves in our fight against marine litter.”

The group plans further clean-up efforts throughout the summer months, inviting all residents interested in volunteering or contributing to future initiatives.
