In a closely watched decision, Hastings Borough Council has approved the construction of a new multi-story car park in the heart of the town. The project aims to alleviate parking congestion and support local businesses by increasing visitor capacity. However, it faced strong opposition from some residents who voiced concerns about environmental impacts and disruption during construction.

The council debated the proposal for several hours before voting to proceed with the plans, emphasizing the need for modern infrastructure that aligns with sustainable practices. Public hearings over recent weeks saw a mix of opinions, highlighting the community’s divided stance on development versus conservation.

As work is set to begin in early summer, local stakeholders will continue discussions on mitigation measures to minimize environmental and social impacts. This decision marks an important step in Hastings’ ongoing urban renewal efforts.
