In a collaborative effort to address safety concerns within the communities of Hastings and Rye, local groups have initiated several projects aimed at enhancing security and fostering community involvement. The initiative includes partnerships between local businesses, residents' associations, and the police force.

Residents in both towns have expressed concern over recent incidents that highlight the need for improved safety measures. To tackle these issues, a series of workshops and town hall meetings are being organized to discuss practical solutions such as better street lighting, neighbourhood watch programs, and increased visibility of local policing services.

Councillor Jane Smith, who is leading the council's community safety team, emphasized the importance of involving all members of the community. 'We believe that by working together, we can create safer environments for everyone,' she said during a recent press conference.

Community leaders and volunteers are encouraging residents to attend upcoming meetings scheduled in both Hastings and Rye over the next few weeks. These gatherings will provide an opportunity for individuals to voice their concerns and contribute ideas towards improving safety measures in their local areas.
