The coastal towns of Hastings and Rye came together last weekend to break a fundraising record, raising over £10,000 for the local charity, Beacon House. The event, which was held at the Marine Hall in St Leonards-on-Sea, featured live music, games, and activities that brought together people from all walks of life.

Organisers were thrilled with the turnout, with an estimated 500 attendees across two days of festivities. Among the highlights were a silent disco on Saturday night and a charity auction that saw several generous local businesses donating items for bidding.

Beacon House’s director, Jane Smith, expressed her gratitude towards the community saying, “This remarkable achievement shows the incredible spirit and generosity of our townsfolk. The funds will go directly into supporting families who are facing challenging times.”

The fundraising event was a testament to the strong sense of community in Hastings and Rye and has already sparked discussions about future collaborations between local charities and residents.
