Glasgow councillor Dan Hutchison addressed the opening session of the conference, emphasizing the importance of this meeting to attendees who are 'starting something new' within Scottish political circles. As Hastings and Rye residents look towards potential ripple effects from these developments, it becomes crucial to understand how such national movements might influence local governance and community engagement.

The conference aims to establish a strong foundation for Your Party Scotland as they seek to make their voice heard on issues relevant not only to Glasgow but also to the broader Scottish region. This includes addressing concerns that resonate with communities like Hastings and Rye, particularly regarding environmental policies, education reforms, and economic development initiatives."
