In a heated council meeting on Thursday evening, Hastings and Rye residents gathered to voice their concerns over recent planning decisions made by the local authority. The agenda focused on proposals for two major developments in the heart of both towns: one being a high-rise residential building near the railway station in Hastings and another redevelopment project aimed at revitalizing the historic town center in Rye.

Proponents argue that these projects are necessary to address the growing housing needs and stimulate economic growth within the region. However, many residents are worried about the potential negative impact on local heritage sites and green spaces.

During the public hearing, over a hundred attendees expressed their views, with many calling for more transparency in decision-making processes and greater involvement from the community at an earlier stage of planning. Council members assured concerned citizens that they would take all opinions into account before making final decisions but also stressed the need to balance development needs with preserving the area's unique character.

The council is set to reconvene next month, where further discussions are expected as stakeholders continue to debate the merits and drawbacks of these proposed changes. Residents interested in participating can submit their comments through the official council website or attend upcoming meetings scheduled for February.
