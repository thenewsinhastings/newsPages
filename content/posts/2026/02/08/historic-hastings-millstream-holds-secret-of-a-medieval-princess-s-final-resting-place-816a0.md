In the heart of Hastings, whispers of an ancient legend have stirred anew. Local folklore suggests that within the meandering waters of one of our town's historic millstreams lies a poignant secret: the final resting place of a daughter of King Cnut, the medieval monarch who ruled England, Denmark, and Norway in the 11th century.

While this tale has been passed down through generations as a matter of local legend rather than historical fact, it continues to capture imaginations and draw interest from both locals and visitors alike. The story speaks not only to our deep ties with history but also to the enduring mystique that Hastings holds for those who know its secrets.

Whether you're a long-time resident or newcomer to the area, there's no denying the allure of connecting with such a rich historical narrative embedded in the fabric of our community. As we continue to explore and appreciate the layers of history beneath us, stories like these remind us of Hastings' unique place in both national and regional histories.
