Residents of Hastings have come together to support a local initiative aimed at preserving the town's coastline. Over the weekend, more than 150 volunteers participated in a beach cleanup event organised by the Hastings Coastal Conservation Group.

The group has been active since last year and aims to raise awareness about the impact of marine pollution on coastal wildlife. During the recent clean-up effort, over two tonnes of litter were collected from the beaches around Hastings and Rye.

Speaking at the event, Sarah Green, founder of the Coastal Conservation Group, highlighted the importance of community involvement in environmental protection efforts. 'Our coastlines are not only a source of beauty but also play a critical role in biodiversity,' she said. 'Every piece of litter removed is one less hazard for marine life.'

Local businesses and schools have joined forces to support these initiatives, providing equipment and resources necessary for the clean-up operations. The efforts demonstrate the strong sense of community and responsibility towards environmental conservation prevalent among Hastings residents.
