A local charity based in Hastings and Rye has launched a winter appeal aimed at providing essential support for vulnerable residents during the colder months. The initiative includes collecting donations of warm clothing, blankets, and food to help those in need.

The charity's spokesperson said, 'With winter approaching, we're reaching out to our community to come together and assist those who might be struggling with heating bills or lack basic necessities.'

Residents are encouraged to contribute by dropping off items at the designated collection points around Hastings and Rye. The charity will also arrange a series of events throughout December to engage the community and raise additional funds.

For more information on how to get involved, please contact the local charity directly or visit their website.
