A local charity has announced the launch of a new food bank initiative to support families and individuals struggling with financial difficulties in Hastings and Rye. The initiative, named 'Feeding Our Neighbors', aims to provide essential groceries and other necessities to those who are experiencing hardship due to rising living costs.

The charity's spokesperson stated that despite strong community support, the demand for food aid continues to rise. With this new project, they hope to offer a more sustainable solution by establishing partnerships with local supermarkets and businesses to secure regular donations of surplus produce.

'Feeding Our Neighbors' will operate out of designated collection points across Hastings and Rye, including St. John's Community Centre and the Rye Hub. The charity encourages members of the community who can spare food or funds to contribute to this vital cause.

For more information about how to get involved or receive assistance from 'Feeding Our Neighbors', contact the local charity at info@feedourneighbors.org.uk.
