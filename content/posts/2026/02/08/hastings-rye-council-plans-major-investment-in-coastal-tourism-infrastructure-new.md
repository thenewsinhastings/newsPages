The Hastings and Rye Borough Council has announced plans to significantly enhance its tourism infrastructure, aiming to boost the local economy by improving facilities along the coastal areas. The proposed investments include upgrades to visitor centres, installation of new amenities at beaches, and improvements to public transportation services connecting key tourist spots.

Councillors have highlighted that these initiatives are part of a broader strategy to diversify economic sources in the face of challenges such as climate change impacts on local industries like fishing and agriculture. The council is also considering partnerships with private sector entities for financing these projects, which are expected to create new jobs and attract more visitors throughout the year.

Public consultations will be held over the next few months to gather feedback from residents and businesses before finalizing the project plans. The council hopes that these efforts will not only bolster tourism but also ensure sustainable development in line with environmental protection goals.
