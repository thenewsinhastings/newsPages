In response to the approaching winter season and its potential impact on vulnerable residents of Hastings, local charity 'Warm Hearts' has launched a new initiative called Winter Warmth. The campaign aims to provide essential support such as food, clothing, and heating assistance to those in need within the community.

The appeal encourages both local businesses and individuals to donate items or funds that can directly help families struggling with rising energy costs and harsh weather conditions. 'Warm Hearts' is particularly urging for contributions of warm clothing, blankets, and non-perishable food items as well as financial donations.

Speaking at the launch event, Jane Thompson, the director of Warm Hearts, expressed her gratitude towards the community's support in past efforts and highlighted this year's increased need due to economic challenges exacerbated by the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. She also invited volunteers interested in helping distribute aid packages to contact the charity for more information.

The initiative will run throughout the winter months with regular collection points being set up across Hastings, including local supermarkets and community centers. For those who wish to contribute or learn more about how they can get involved, Warm Hearts has launched a dedicated website where details of drop-off locations and volunteer opportunities are available.
