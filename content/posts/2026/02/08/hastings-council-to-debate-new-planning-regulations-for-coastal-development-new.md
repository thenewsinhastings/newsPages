The Hastings Borough Council is set to debate new planning regulations aimed at managing coastal development in the area. The proposed changes are designed to address concerns over potential environmental impacts and ensure sustainable growth along the coastline.

Councillors will discuss measures that include stricter guidelines for building heights, limitations on construction materials to mitigate coastal erosion risks, and increased scrutiny of plans that could affect local wildlife habitats. These regulations come in response to recent developments which have raised eyebrows among both residents and conservationists alike.

The council meeting is scheduled for next week and will be open to public participation. Members of the community are encouraged to attend and voice their opinions on how Hastings should balance its economic growth with environmental preservation.
