The Hastings and Rye Council has recently announced the allocation of funds to several community groups in the area. The initiative aims to support local projects that enhance community cohesion and provide essential services for residents.

Among the beneficiaries are the Hastings Lifeguard Service, which received a grant to improve safety at local beaches, and the Rye Community Garden, which will use its funding to expand gardening workshops and activities for all ages. Additionally, the Council has also provided support to the Hastings Food Bank, helping it maintain food supplies during challenging economic times.

The Mayor of Hastings and Rye praised these efforts, stating that 'the well-being and engagement of our local communities are top priorities.' He added that such investments not only strengthen community ties but also contribute positively to the social fabric of both towns.

These funds come from a recently approved budget, highlighting the Council's commitment to fostering vibrant and supportive local environments. For more information on these projects or future opportunities for funding, residents can contact their local councillors.
