The local community in Hastings and Rye has been discussing the potential impact of international trade agreements, particularly focusing on how these might affect agriculture and economic growth within the region. Piyush Goyal’s statement that there is no harm to farmers under India-U.S. trade pact reassures local producers concerned about similar arrangements. Local farmers and business leaders have gathered to discuss opportunities and challenges presented by such pacts, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong support for regional agriculture.

In a related development, the community continues to follow international relations closely as Prime Minister Modi emphasized India's role as a trusted partner for growth during his visit to Malaysia. This highlights the interconnectedness of global economic policies and their potential influence on local economies such as Hastings and Rye.
