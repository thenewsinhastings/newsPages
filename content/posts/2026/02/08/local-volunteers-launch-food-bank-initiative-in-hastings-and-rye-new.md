In a heartening display of community spirit, local volunteers have launched an initiative to establish a new food bank in both Hastings and Rye. The project aims to provide essential support for those facing financial difficulties during these challenging times.

The food bank will operate from a central location in the town centre, offering groceries and other necessities on a weekly basis. Volunteers are actively recruiting more helpers to ensure the smooth operation of this vital service.

Residents wishing to contribute can donate non-perishable items or offer their time as volunteers. For those seeking assistance, the food bank will provide support to individuals facing temporary financial hardship due to unforeseen circumstances such as unemployment or illness.

Local councillors have praised the initiative, noting its importance in addressing the immediate needs of the community. They encourage all members of the public to contribute and assist in any way possible.
