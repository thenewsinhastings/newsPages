The Hastings Borough Council met this week to discuss crucial plans aimed at protecting the town's coastline and boosting tourism. During the meeting, councillors debated several proposals including the construction of new sea defences along parts of the coast and initiatives to enhance visitor experiences in key areas such as Rock-a-Nore and Alexandra Park.

Councillor Sarah Thompson highlighted that the proposed improvements would not only safeguard local residents from potential flooding but also attract more visitors throughout the year. She stressed the importance of striking a balance between preserving Hastings' rich heritage and promoting economic growth through tourism.

The council is now seeking public feedback on these plans, with consultation set to begin next month. Residents and businesses are encouraged to share their views and suggestions via the official council website or by attending an upcoming community meeting at the town hall.
