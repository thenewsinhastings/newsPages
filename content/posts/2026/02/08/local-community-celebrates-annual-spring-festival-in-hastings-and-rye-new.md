The annual spring festival in Hastings and Rye was a resounding success, bringing together residents and visitors for an afternoon of fun and celebration. The event, which took place on the lawns of Castle Hill, featured live music performances by local artists, children's games, and delicious food stalls offering traditional seaside treats.

Over 500 people attended this year’s festival, a significant increase from last year due to the return of in-person events after two years of cancellations. The highlight of the day was the crowning of Miss Hastings & Rye 2023, with local schools participating in the parade and showcasing their talents.

Organizers expressed gratitude for the community's support and highlighted the economic boost brought by such events to local businesses. They also mentioned that a portion of the proceeds would be donated to charity initiatives supporting youth programs in Hastings and Rye.
