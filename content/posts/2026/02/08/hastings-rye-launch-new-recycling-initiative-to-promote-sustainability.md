The towns of Hastings and Rye have joined forces to introduce a new recycling initiative aimed at reducing waste and promoting sustainable practices among residents. The program, which will be rolled out over the next few months, includes an expanded collection service for recyclable materials and educational campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of recycling.

Mayor Tom Greenfield stated in a press conference that 'this is a significant step forward in our commitment to preserving the environment and making Hastings and Rye greener places to live.' He also noted that local businesses have been supportive of the initiative, with several companies pledging to use recycled materials in their products.

Residents are encouraged to participate actively by using the new recycling bins provided and attending upcoming workshops to learn more about waste reduction techniques. The community has responded positively, showing a high level of enthusiasm for environmental conservation efforts.
