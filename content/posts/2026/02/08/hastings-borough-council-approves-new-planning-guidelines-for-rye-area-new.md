In a significant move to shape the future of the Hastings and Rye area, the Hastings Borough Council has approved new planning guidelines aimed at enhancing sustainability and community development. The revised guidelines were passed after extensive consultations with local residents and businesses, reflecting a commitment to balanced growth that preserves heritage while accommodating modern needs.

Councillor Emily Green, leader of the council, stated: 'These new guidelines are designed to address key concerns raised by our community over recent years regarding urban sprawl and environmental impact. We have worked closely with architects, planners, and local stakeholders to ensure these regulations are both practical and visionary.'

The new rules will influence various aspects including building heights, green spaces allocation, and the integration of renewable energy solutions in construction projects. They also include stricter measures for heritage preservation within Rye's historic district.

Residents can expect further consultations as specific development proposals come forward under these new guidelines. The council has set up an online portal where feedback on upcoming applications will be actively sought to ensure community voices continue to shape the local landscape.
