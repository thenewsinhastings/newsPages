The Hastings and Rye Council has given the green light to a new recycling program designed to improve waste management and reduce environmental impact within the borough. The initiative, which includes the installation of additional recycling bins in public areas and educational workshops for residents, is set to roll out from next month.

Councillor Jane Thompson, who heads the Environmental Committee, stated that the program aims to increase the borough's recycling rate by at least 10% over the next two years. She emphasized the importance of community involvement, encouraging residents to participate actively in the new system.

Local environmental groups have welcomed the decision, praising the council for taking proactive steps towards sustainability. However, some concerns were raised about the initial cost and logistical challenges involved with implementation.

The program will receive funding from both local council budgets and government grants, ensuring a steady stream of resources to support its operation and maintenance.

Residents interested in learning more or volunteering can visit the Hastings Borough Council website for further information and upcoming event schedules.
