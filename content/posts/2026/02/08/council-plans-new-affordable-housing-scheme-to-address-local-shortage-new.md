The Hastings & Rye Council has announced ambitious plans for a new affordable housing scheme aimed at addressing the severe shortage of affordable homes in both towns. The initiative, which is set to be discussed further at next month’s council meeting, aims to provide 100 additional units over the next three years.

Councillor Jane Thompson, who is leading the project, stated that the lack of affordable housing has been a growing concern for residents and businesses alike. 'With many local workers struggling with sky-high rents, we are determined to create opportunities for people from all backgrounds to live in our communities,' she added.

The proposal includes partnerships with private developers and social housing providers to ensure a steady supply of units at below-market rates. However, the plan has already faced some criticism from local property owners who fear it could impact house prices and property values within Hastings & Rye.

Residents are invited to attend an open meeting scheduled for next week where they can voice their opinions on the proposed scheme. Further details about this event will be published in upcoming editions of our newspaper.
