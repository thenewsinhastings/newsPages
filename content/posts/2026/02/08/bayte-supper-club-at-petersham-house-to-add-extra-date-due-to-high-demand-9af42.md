The Bayte Supper Club, a unique dining experience in the heart of Hastings, has announced an additional date due to overwhelming public interest. Originally scheduled for one night only at Petersham House, this culinary event now offers more opportunities for food enthusiasts to indulge in a memorable evening.

Located just outside Rye, Petersham House is known for its charming ambiance and rich history. The supper club, which features carefully crafted menus by local chefs, has garnered significant attention from both locals and visitors alike, prompting organizers to extend the event's run.

This additional date not only caters to those who missed out on initial tickets but also introduces new culinary experiences tailored for the community’s appreciation of fine dining. Interested attendees are advised to book early, as previous events have sold out quickly.
