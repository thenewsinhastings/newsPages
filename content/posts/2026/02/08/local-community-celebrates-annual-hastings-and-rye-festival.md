The picturesque towns of Hastings and Rye came alive with a week-long celebration as the annual Hastings and Rye Festival returned to its roots. Held in the heart of both coastal communities, this year’s festival featured an array of cultural events including music concerts, art exhibitions, and culinary delights.

Organizers expressed their excitement about the return to traditional formats after two years of pandemic-induced restrictions. Mayor Jane Smith highlighted the festival's role in fostering unity among residents: “This event is a testament to our community’s resilience and creativity.”

The highlight was the grand parade on Saturday, which saw hundreds of participants marching through the streets adorned with vibrant costumes and floats celebrating local heritage. Attendees also enjoyed an outdoor market featuring handcrafted goods from local artisans.
