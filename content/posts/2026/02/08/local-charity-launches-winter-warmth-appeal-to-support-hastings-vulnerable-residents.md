The local charity 'Heartfelt Hope' has launched its annual Winter Warmth appeal, aimed at providing support and assistance to the vulnerable residents of Hastings during the colder months. The initiative includes everything from distributing warm clothing and blankets to offering hot meals at community centers across the town.

Speaking at a press conference today, Emma Taylor, director of Heartfelt Hope, emphasized the importance of this year’s appeal due to the ongoing economic challenges faced by many families in Hastings. 'Our goal is not just to provide physical warmth but also emotional support during these difficult times,' she said.

Volunteers from across the community are being recruited to help with the distribution and collection efforts. Residents wishing to donate or volunteer can contact Heartfelt Hope at their local branch in the town center.
