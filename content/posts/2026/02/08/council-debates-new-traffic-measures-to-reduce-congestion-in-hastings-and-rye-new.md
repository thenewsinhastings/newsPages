The Hastings Borough Council and Rye Town Council are set to discuss new traffic measures aimed at reducing congestion on local roads, particularly during peak hours. The proposals include the introduction of a Low Emission Zone in central Hastings and timed road closures in certain residential areas of Rye.

Residents have expressed mixed feelings about the proposed changes. Some welcome the initiative as a step towards improving air quality and making the streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists. Others are concerned that the measures may cause delays and inconvenience, especially for those with essential daily commutes or deliveries.

The councils will hold public consultations to gather feedback from residents before finalizing any plans. The aim is to implement the new traffic management system by early 2024, pending approval at upcoming council meetings.
