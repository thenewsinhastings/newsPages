The local charity, Warm Hearts Foundation, has launched its annual Winter Warmth appeal aimed at providing essential support for vulnerable residents in Hastings during the colder months.

With temperatures dropping and energy costs rising, the foundation is calling on the community to donate items such as blankets, warm clothing, and food parcels to help those struggling financially. The charity will also distribute fuel vouchers and provide hot meals at their weekly drop-in sessions.

“We are seeing a significant increase in demand for our services this year,” said Jane Smith, founder of Warm Hearts Foundation. “We urge local residents and businesses to come forward and support us in making a real difference to the lives of those who need it most.”

Drop-off points have been set up at several locations across Hastings including the local library, community centres, and supermarkets. Donations can also be made online via the charity’s website.

For more information or to arrange a collection, please contact Warm Hearts Foundation on 01475-XXXXXX.
