In a significant move towards safeguarding the Hastings coastline from further erosion and damage due to climate change, Hastings Borough Council has unanimously agreed to allocate an additional £500,000 for coastal protection projects. The decision follows months of discussions with environmental experts and local residents who have been advocating for urgent action to protect homes and businesses located near the seafront.

The funding will be used to enhance existing defences such as sea walls and groynes along the vulnerable parts of the coast, aiming to mitigate the risks posed by severe weather events. Councillor Jane Thompson, speaking at yesterday's council meeting, emphasised the importance of this investment: 'Our coastline is a vital part of Hastings' heritage and economy. This additional funding will help us secure its future for generations to come.'

Environmental campaigners have welcomed the decision, praising the council’s proactive approach in addressing climate change impacts locally. However, some local businesses are concerned about potential disruptions during construction phases. Council officials assure that every effort will be made to minimise disruption while ensuring effective implementation of these crucial measures.
