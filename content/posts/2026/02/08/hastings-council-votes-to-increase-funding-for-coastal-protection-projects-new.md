In a unanimous vote yesterday, Hastings Borough Council approved an increase in funding for coastal protection projects aimed at safeguarding the town's beaches and cliffs from the ongoing threat of severe weather events. The decision comes as part of the council’s broader strategy to protect local communities and infrastructure from rising sea levels and storm surges.

The additional funds will be used to bolster existing defences, such as the construction of new rock barriers along the shoreline, and to invest in long-term monitoring and maintenance of coastal structures. Council members highlighted the importance of proactive measures given the potential economic and environmental impacts of climate change on Hastings' tourism industry and local ecosystems.

Councillor Jane Thompson, who spearheaded the proposal, stated that “This is a crucial step towards ensuring the safety and prosperity of our community for years to come. We are committed to working closely with regional authorities to secure further resources and support.”

Residents and businesses in Rye have also expressed concern over similar threats, with some calling for a joint initiative between Hastings and Rye councils to address shared challenges effectively.

The council is set to review the progress of these projects annually, ensuring transparency and accountability in their implementation. For more information on coastal protection efforts and upcoming public consultations, visit the Hastings Borough Council website.
