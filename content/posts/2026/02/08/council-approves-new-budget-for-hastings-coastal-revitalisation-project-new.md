The Hastings Borough Council has approved the budget for a significant coastal revitalisation project, aimed at boosting tourism and improving local infrastructure. The project is expected to bring substantial investment into the area over the next three years.

At Tuesday's council meeting, councillors voted unanimously in favour of allocating £2 million towards the initial phase of the scheme, which includes refurbishing the seafront promenade, enhancing public spaces, and installing new lighting features for aesthetic improvements and increased safety at night. The proposal was met with broad support from local residents and businesses, who see this as an opportunity to rejuvenate Hastings’ coastal appeal.

Councillor Jane Thompson, leader of the council, highlighted that the project aims not only to attract more visitors but also to create jobs within the local community. She stated: 'This budget approval marks a significant step forward in our commitment to making Hastings and Rye attractive destinations for both tourists and residents alike.'

Environmental advocates have expressed cautious optimism about the potential ecological impact of the changes, with assurances from the council that sustainability will be at the forefront of all development decisions. The project team is currently working on detailed plans and engaging with local stakeholders to ensure community input throughout the process.

Residents interested in contributing their ideas or concerns are encouraged to attend upcoming public consultations scheduled for early next month.
