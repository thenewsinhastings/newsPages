A resident from Eastbourne has endured over a year of hardship due to the lack of accessible housing, highlighting the ongoing struggle faced by many in the community. The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous for privacy reasons, has been trapped upstairs in her home because it lacks the necessary modifications to accommodate her mobility needs.

Local authorities are aware of her situation and have acknowledged the long wait times for such accommodations. Community members and advocates continue to push for improvements in housing policies to ensure that individuals with disabilities can access homes that meet their needs without undue delay.

The case underscores broader issues surrounding accessible housing in Eastbourne, Hastings & Rye and beyond. As the local community awaits further action from social services, there remains a collective call for more immediate solutions to improve living conditions for those with mobility challenges.
