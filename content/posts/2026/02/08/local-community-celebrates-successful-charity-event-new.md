The local community came together this weekend for the annual Hastings and Rye charity run, raising over £50,000 for the town's children’s hospice. The event saw a record-breaking number of participants, with runners from all ages and backgrounds joining in to support the cause.

Organisers reported that despite challenging weather conditions on Saturday morning, spirits remained high as friends, families, and local businesses rallied together to make the day a success. Local dignitaries also took part in the event, showing their support for community initiatives.

Proceeds from the run will go directly towards funding vital care services at the hospice, ensuring that more children can receive the support they need within their own communities. Community leaders praised the local generosity and highlighted the importance of such events in uniting residents behind a common cause.
