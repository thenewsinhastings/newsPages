The Hastings Borough Council has adopted a new climate change strategy aimed at reducing the town's carbon footprint and increasing sustainability. The council approved the plan during its latest meeting, which includes initiatives such as promoting electric vehicle charging points across the borough, enhancing green spaces, and encouraging local businesses to adopt environmentally friendly practices.

Councillor Jane Smith, who spearheaded the initiative, said: “This is a significant step forward for Hastings in our efforts to combat climate change. The strategy not only addresses immediate concerns but also sets long-term goals that align with national targets.”

Residents are encouraged to participate in upcoming consultations and provide feedback on how these initiatives can be implemented more effectively within the community.

For more information, visit the Hastings Borough Council website or attend one of the public meetings scheduled for later this month.
