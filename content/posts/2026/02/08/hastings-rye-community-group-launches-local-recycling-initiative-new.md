The Hastings and Rye community has seen the launch of a new recycling initiative aimed at promoting sustainable living practices in the area. Organised by local volunteers, the scheme encourages residents to separate waste more effectively and provides access to additional recycling bins across key locations.

The group is planning monthly clean-up events around popular beaches and parks to raise awareness about littering issues and the importance of preserving natural beauty spots for future generations. The initiative has received support from both the Hastings Borough Council and Rye Town Council, who are committed to supporting community-led projects that enhance environmental sustainability in the region.
