The Hastings Borough Council has approved a budget proposal that includes significant funds for the construction of a new community centre in Rye. The project aims to provide local residents with additional recreational and social spaces, which have been lacking due to recent population growth.

Councillor Emma Johnson, who proposed the initiative, stated, “The community centre will not only serve as a hub for cultural events but also offer essential services such as after-school programmes and elderly care facilities. It's a crucial step in ensuring that all residents feel valued and supported.”

Local residents are generally supportive of the project, which is expected to create employment opportunities during its construction phase and contribute positively to Rye’s economy.

The council will now begin the tender process for architects and contractors who are interested in working on this ambitious development. Construction is anticipated to commence early next year, pending approval from relevant planning authorities.
