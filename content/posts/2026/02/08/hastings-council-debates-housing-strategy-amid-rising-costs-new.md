In a heated council meeting yesterday, Hastings Borough Council discussed the implementation of a new housing strategy aimed at addressing the escalating costs of living in the region. The proposal, which includes measures to increase social and affordable housing options, was met with mixed reactions from councillors.

Councillor Jane Smith highlighted the urgent need for more accessible accommodation due to recent reports showing an 8% rise in rental prices across Hastings over the past year. However, other members of the council expressed concerns about the feasibility of such plans given current financial constraints and potential impacts on local businesses.

The debate also touched upon the proposed introduction of rent control measures, a move that has sparked considerable interest among residents who have faced difficulties in securing affordable housing due to market pressures. While some councillors supported the idea as essential for stabilising the rental market, others argued against it, citing possible negative effects on investment in new properties.

As Hastings continues to attract more newcomers, finding solutions to provide adequate and affordable homes remains a critical issue. The council is set to revisit this topic at an upcoming meeting where further details of the proposed strategy will be discussed.
