In a significant move towards enhancing community infrastructure and services in Hastings and Rye, the Hastings Borough Council has approved its latest budget allocation. The new financial plan aims to fund various community projects designed to improve local amenities and address pressing needs within the borough.

The council’s approval includes substantial funding for parks and green spaces maintenance, road repairs, and educational initiatives aimed at supporting young people in Rye and surrounding areas. Council leader, Councillor Jane Smith, highlighted the importance of these investments during a press conference at Hastings Town Hall: “This budget reflects our commitment to sustainable development while ensuring that the needs of all residents are met.”

The proposed budget also includes measures for environmental sustainability, such as funding for renewable energy projects and waste reduction schemes. Additionally, there is an allocation for community engagement programs aimed at fostering stronger connections within the local population.

Local residents will have an opportunity to provide feedback on specific aspects of the budget through public consultations scheduled throughout the autumn months. These forums are expected to facilitate direct dialogue between council members and the community, ensuring that all voices are heard in the planning process.
