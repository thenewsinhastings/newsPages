The Hastings Borough Council has approved a budget proposal aimed at the construction of a new community centre in Rye, set to enhance local amenities and support social activities. The proposed project includes state-of-the-art facilities for various age groups and interests, aiming to strengthen the sense of community within the town.

During yesterday's council meeting, councillors debated the financial implications of the initiative, with many highlighting its potential benefits for residents, including increased access to educational workshops, recreational programs, and social events. The estimated cost of £2 million will be funded through a combination of local government funding and private donations, ensuring sustainability and community involvement.

The new centre is expected to provide space for youth clubs, senior citizen activities, arts and crafts classes, as well as meeting rooms for local groups. Mayor Jane Foster emphasized the importance of this project in addressing the growing needs of Rye's expanding population and fostering a more inclusive environment.

Local residents are encouraged to participate in upcoming public consultations to share their ideas on how the centre could best serve the community. Plans are also underway to involve local businesses, schools, and voluntary organisations in the development process to ensure that the project meets the diverse needs of Rye's inhabitants.
