The Hastings Borough Council has announced a significant funding boost for the ongoing seafront revitalisation project, set to transform the town’s iconic coastline into an even more attractive and accessible area. The investment aims to enhance tourism, improve local amenities, and create employment opportunities for residents.

Council leaders say the funds will be used to implement phase two of the project, which includes the installation of new lighting systems along the promenade, the construction of additional seating areas, and the creation of an expanded beach access point. Local businesses have welcomed the news as a major boost to the local economy, with many anticipating increased footfall during peak tourist seasons.

Speaking at today’s council meeting, Councillor Rachel Thompson highlighted the project’s importance for both locals and visitors: 'Our seafront is not just a landmark but a vital part of our community. This funding will ensure that Hastings remains a top destination while also preserving its unique character.'

Environmental experts have praised the initiative for incorporating sustainable design principles, such as using locally-sourced materials and implementing energy-efficient solutions to reduce carbon emissions.

Residents are invited to attend an upcoming public consultation meeting on Thursday, 13th April at 6:00 PM at the Town Hall. Here they will be able to learn more about the plans and provide feedback.
