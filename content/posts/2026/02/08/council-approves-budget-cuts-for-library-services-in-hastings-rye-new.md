The council of Hastings and Rye has approved a budget that includes significant cuts to library services across both towns. The decision, which was narrowly passed by councillors last night, aims to address the borough’s financial deficit but has sparked controversy among local residents who rely on library resources for education and community engagement.

Councillors argued that the measures are necessary to maintain essential services such as social care and emergency response during challenging economic times. However, opponents of the cuts have organised a petition and plan to gather signatures from concerned citizens to present to the council at its next meeting in an effort to reverse this decision.

The library network, which includes several branches across Hastings and Rye, has been praised for its role in fostering literacy and promoting community cohesion. With these budget adjustments now in place, hours of operation will be reduced, potentially impacting those who depend on libraries for internet access and educational materials.
