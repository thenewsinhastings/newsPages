In a heartwarming display of community spirit, the volunteers behind the Rye Community Garden project gathered last weekend to celebrate their success over the past year. The garden, which was established on a neglected plot near the town centre, has not only transformed an eyesore into a lush oasis but also brought residents together in a shared pursuit of greenery and wellbeing.

Speakers at the event included local councillor Jane Miller who praised the initiative for its positive impact on both physical health and community cohesion. She highlighted how the garden had become a focal point for social interaction, especially among older residents and young families alike.

The event featured tours of the gardens where visitors could admire the variety of plants and flowers that have flourished under the careful stewardship of local volunteers. Children were also given the opportunity to plant seeds in specially designated areas designed to educate them about the importance of gardening and sustainability practices.

As the sun set on the successful celebration, organizers expressed their gratitude towards all those who had contributed time, effort, or donations to make the garden a reality. They invited interested parties to join upcoming volunteer sessions where participants can continue to nurture this communal space.
