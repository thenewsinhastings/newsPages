The Seaview Project in St Leonards has received significant support from Energise Sussex Coast (ESC) through its recently launched Retrofit Advice Service. Gabriel Carlyle, ESC’s advisor, conducted an interview with Dave Perry of the Seaview Project to discuss the new initiatives underway at their Gresham Way location.

Dave Perry highlighted that the collaboration with ESC has been invaluable in helping the project progress smoothly. The advice service provides essential guidance on retrofitting properties for energy efficiency and sustainability, which is particularly important as the Seaview Project aims to enhance its facilities and services within the community.

With the support of ESC’s experts, the Seaview Project can continue its work towards improving living conditions and providing essential services to those in need. The partnership showcases how local organizations can collaborate effectively for mutual benefit and positive change.
