The Hastings & Rye Senior Citizens' Club marked a significant milestone this weekend with the celebration of their silver jubilee. Founded in 1998, the club has been instrumental in providing social support and recreational activities for senior residents of both towns.

Over the course of two days, members and guests enjoyed a range of activities including a celebratory lunch at the Rye Town Hall, where Mayor Sarah Green gave an address praising the club's contributions to community life. The event also featured live music, poetry readings by local seniors, and a special exhibition showcasing the history of the club through photographs and memorabilia.

Club president Margaret Brown said: 'We are delighted to reach this milestone year, which has been made all the more special due to the continued support from our members and the wider community. The silver jubilee is an opportunity for us to reflect on our achievements over the past 25 years and look forward to many more years of supporting our seniors.'
