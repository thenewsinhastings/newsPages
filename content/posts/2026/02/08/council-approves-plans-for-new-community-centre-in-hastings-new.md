The Hastings Borough Council has approved plans to construct a new community centre in the heart of Hastings town. The decision was made during a heated council meeting on Tuesday, with councillors voting unanimously in favour of the proposal.

The new facility aims to provide local residents with an array of services including after-school clubs, fitness classes, and social events for seniors. Mayor Jane Thompson stated that the project is a significant step towards enhancing community life in Hastings and Rye, reflecting the council's commitment to fostering inclusivity and support within the region.

Opposition members welcomed the news but raised concerns about funding sustainability and potential environmental impacts. However, the council has assured that all necessary measures will be taken to address these issues effectively.

Local residents expressed mixed reactions, with many praising the initiative as a long-overdue improvement for the area, while others questioned its practicality given recent budget cuts in other essential services.

Construction is expected to begin early next year, subject to planning permission and additional funding securing.
