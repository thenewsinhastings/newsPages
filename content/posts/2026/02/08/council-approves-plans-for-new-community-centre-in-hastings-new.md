In a unanimous decision, Hastings Borough Council has approved the plans to construct a new community centre in the heart of the town. The proposed facility will serve as a hub for local residents, offering a range of services and activities aimed at fostering community spirit and enhancing social cohesion.

The project, which has been under discussion since last year, aims to address the growing demand for communal spaces that cater to various age groups and interests within Hastings. Speaking about the decision, Councillor Jane Thompson highlighted the importance of such infrastructure in supporting local communities: “This new centre will not only provide a space for social gatherings but also support our efforts in promoting mental health awareness and community engagement.”

Construction is expected to commence in spring next year with an estimated completion date by autumn 2024. The project has received positive feedback from the public, with many residents expressing enthusiasm about the prospect of having such a facility close to home.
