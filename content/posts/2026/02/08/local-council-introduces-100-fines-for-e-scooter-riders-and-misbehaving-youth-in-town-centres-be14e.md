The local council has taken action to address the issues of e-scooter riders and misbehaving young people in Hastings and Rye town centres. New regulations will impose fines up to £100 for individuals caught riding electric scooters without proper licensing or insurance, as well as those engaging in antisocial behaviour such as using catapults or slingshots.

The council asserts these measures are necessary to ensure public safety and the wellbeing of residents and visitors alike. In recent months, there have been several incidents involving reckless scooter riders causing accidents and disruptions on pavements and roads. Additionally, reports of youth groups engaging in disruptive activities with projectiles such as catapults or slingshots have risen.

Local councillor Mark Thompson stated: 'This new approach is about maintaining a safe environment for everyone who uses our town centres. We understand the convenience e-scooters provide but also acknowledge the risks they pose if not used responsibly.'

Community leaders and local businesses support these steps, viewing them as essential to preserving the lively yet peaceful atmosphere of Hastings and Rye.

Residents are encouraged to report any incidents involving unlicensed scooter use or antisocial behaviour through the council's dedicated hotline. The council aims to provide a balanced response that promotes responsible conduct among young people while safeguarding public spaces.
