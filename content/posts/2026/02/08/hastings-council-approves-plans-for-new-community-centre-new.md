The Hastings Borough Council has given the green light to plans for a new community centre in Rye, marking a significant step forward in enhancing local facilities. The proposal was approved at last week's council meeting after months of consultation and planning. Councillors have praised the project as an essential investment in the area’s social infrastructure.

The new community centre is set to be located on a currently underutilized plot of land and will serve as a hub for various local initiatives, including youth programmes, adult education classes, and senior activities. The facility is expected to bring together residents from diverse backgrounds and foster greater community engagement and cohesion.

Local councillor Jane Thompson expressed her delight with the decision: “This project has been a priority for many years now, and it’s fantastic that we are finally in a position to move forward with its construction. Our aim is to create a space where everyone feels welcome and supported.”

Construction on the community centre is anticipated to commence early next year, pending further planning approvals and funding arrangements. The council has committed to keeping local residents updated throughout the development process.

The announcement has been welcomed by both community leaders and residents alike, who view the new centre as a cornerstone of future social and cultural activities in Rye.
