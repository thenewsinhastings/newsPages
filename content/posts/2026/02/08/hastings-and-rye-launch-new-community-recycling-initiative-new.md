The Hastings and Rye community is set to benefit from a new recycling initiative aimed at promoting sustainable practices among residents. The programme, which will be rolled out across both towns, includes the introduction of additional recycling bins in public spaces and educational workshops for local schools.

Mayor Sarah Thompson expressed her enthusiasm about the project, stating, 'We are committed to fostering an environment where every resident can contribute towards a cleaner future.' She added that the initiative is part of a broader strategy to reduce waste and improve environmental standards within Hastings and Rye.

The recycling drive will also feature community engagement events over the coming months, inviting residents to learn more about composting, upcycling projects, and how they can participate in local clean-up efforts. These initiatives aim not only to raise awareness but also to encourage active participation from all members of the public.

Local businesses have been invited to partner with the initiative by incorporating recycling practices into their operations. The council hopes this collaborative approach will set a positive example for other communities looking to enhance their environmental sustainability.
