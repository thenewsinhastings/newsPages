The Hastings and Rye business community was shaken this morning when armed police officers stormed a local industrial park, placing the site under immediate lockdown. The rapid response by law enforcement is believed to be in reaction to an unspecified incident that required urgent action.

Local sources have reported that no injuries were sustained during the operation, but employees on-site had been instructed to remain inside their buildings until further notice. Police maintained a visible presence around the perimeter of the business park for several hours before lifting security measures late into the afternoon.

The exact nature and outcome of the incident are yet to be disclosed by authorities, who are expected to provide more details in an official statement later this week. Meanwhile, local businesses within the affected area have been advised to check for updates via the police website or social media channels as further information becomes available.
