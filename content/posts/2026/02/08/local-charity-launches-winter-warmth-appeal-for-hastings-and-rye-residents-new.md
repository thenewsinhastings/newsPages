A local charity in the Hastings and Rye area has launched its annual Winter Warmth Appeal to provide essential support to vulnerable residents during the colder months. The initiative aims to ensure that those who are struggling financially or living alone can stay warm and safe as temperatures drop.

The appeal will distribute funds for heating bills, emergency fuel vouchers, and clothing donations. Local volunteers have been working tirelessly to collect items such as blankets, coats, and scarves for distribution across the community.

Residents in need are encouraged to contact the charity’s helpline to receive assistance. The organization also welcomes donations from generous members of the public who wish to contribute to this vital cause.

For more information or to make a donation, visit the charity’s website at www.examplecharity.org.uk or call their helpline on 01424 XXXX.
