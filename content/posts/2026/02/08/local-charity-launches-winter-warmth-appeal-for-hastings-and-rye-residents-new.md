The local charity organisation 'Hands of Hope' has launched a new appeal to support vulnerable residents in Hastings and Rye during the upcoming winter months. The initiative, named Winter Warmth Appeal, aims to provide essential heating assistance and clothing to those facing financial difficulties.

Speaking at a press conference on Monday, the charity's director, Jane Smith, highlighted the importance of community solidarity during challenging times: 'As we approach the colder season, it’s crucial that no one feels isolated or cold. Our Winter Warmth Appeal will help ensure that every resident in Hastings and Rye can stay warm and safe this winter.'

The charity invites members of the public to donate money, clothing, and essential household items such as blankets and heaters. Drop-off points have been set up at several locations across both towns.

For those interested in volunteering or making a donation, more information is available on Hands of Hope's website or by calling their hotline number: 01424 XXXXXX.
