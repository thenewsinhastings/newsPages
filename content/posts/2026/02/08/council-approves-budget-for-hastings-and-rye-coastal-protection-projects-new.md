The Hastings and Rye Council has approved a significant budget allocation aimed at enhancing coastal protection measures in response to rising sea levels and increased storm activity. The council's decision reflects a growing concern for the safety of local residents and businesses, as well as the preservation of historic landmarks along the coastline.

The allocated funds will be used to upgrade existing sea walls, install new flood defenses, and improve drainage systems throughout the affected areas. Additionally, a portion of the budget will support environmental studies to better understand the long-term impacts of climate change on the local ecosystem.

Councillor Jane Roberts, Chair of the Environmental Committee, emphasized the importance of these measures: 'This investment is crucial for safeguarding our coastline and ensuring that future generations can enjoy the beauty and heritage of Hastings and Rye.'

Local residents and business owners have expressed mixed feelings about the proposed changes. While many welcome the proactive approach towards coastal protection, others are concerned about potential disruptions during construction and the overall cost to taxpayers.

The council will continue to engage with community members and stakeholders to ensure that all voices are heard throughout the implementation process.
