The local senior centre in Hastings has been awarded a significant grant from the East Sussex County Council to fund much-needed renovations. The grant, totalling £50,000, will allow for improvements such as modernising facilities and enhancing safety measures at the facility.

Community members and volunteers have expressed their gratitude towards the council’s support, highlighting the importance of maintaining vibrant spaces where elderly residents can socialise and participate in activities that promote mental wellbeing. The renovations are expected to be completed by late autumn next year, ensuring minimal disruption for users during the busy summer season.

The senior centre has become a focal point within Hastings, fostering intergenerational relationships through various events and workshops. Local councillor Jane Thompson praised the council's decision, stating it would 'bring joy to many in our community.'

For more information about the project or how to get involved as a volunteer, interested parties are encouraged to contact the senior centre directly.
