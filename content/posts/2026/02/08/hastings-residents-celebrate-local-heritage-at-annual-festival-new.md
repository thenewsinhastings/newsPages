The annual Hastings Heritage Festival returned to the town centre this weekend, drawing thousands of visitors and locals alike. The festival celebrated the rich history and culture of Hastings with a range of activities including live music performances, historical reenactments, craft stalls, and guided tours of local landmarks.

"It's wonderful to see so many people come together to celebrate our town's heritage," said Jane Thompson, a long-time resident and volunteer at the festival. "Events like these are crucial in preserving our community spirit and educating younger generations about Hastings' unique past." 

Organisers reported that the event had a significant economic impact on local businesses, with many cafes, shops, and hotels reporting increased footfall over the weekend. The Heritage Festival has become an important part of the Hastings calendar and continues to grow in popularity each year.
