The Hastings and Rye Borough Council has proposed significant changes to the coastal protection schemes that aim to safeguard the local coastline against rising sea levels and increased storm activity. The proposals, which have been met with mixed reactions from both residents and environmental groups, include plans for new flood defences along parts of the beach as well as adjustments to existing barriers.

The council argues that these changes are necessary due to recent data indicating a higher risk of flooding in areas previously deemed safe. However, some local stakeholders have raised concerns over potential impacts on wildlife habitats and the aesthetic value of the coastline.

Council leader Alex Wilson stated at a press conference this morning: 'We recognise the importance of preserving our beautiful beaches for future generations while also ensuring public safety. These proposals strike a balance between environmental conservation and practical necessity.'

Public consultations regarding these changes will commence next month, inviting residents to provide feedback on the proposed alterations before final decisions are made.
