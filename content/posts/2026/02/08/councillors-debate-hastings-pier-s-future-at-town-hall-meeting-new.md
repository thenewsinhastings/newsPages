At a heated meeting held last night in the Hastings town hall, councillors from across Rye and Hastings debated the future of the iconic Hastings Pier. The pier has faced significant financial challenges over recent years, leading to its closure for safety reasons.

During the discussion, Councillor Emma Green from Rye highlighted the economic importance of the pier to both towns, stating that reopening it could bring much-needed tourism revenue back into the area. Conversely, Councillor Mark Evans raised concerns about the financial risks and questioned whether sufficient funds were available for its restoration.

The meeting also saw the presentation of a report by local business owners who have been affected by the closure, urging the council to take swift action to reopen the pier as soon as possible. Meanwhile, environmental campaigners argued that any redevelopment must prioritise sustainability and long-term maintenance.

Council leader David Thomas concluded the debate by calling for a detailed financial review before making any final decisions. He emphasised the need for a balanced approach that considers both economic benefits and environmental concerns. The council has announced further public consultations to engage with local residents on potential plans.
