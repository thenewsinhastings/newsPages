The Hastings Borough Council has approved a significant budget allocation for the ongoing redevelopment of the town's seafront, aimed at revitalizing the area and boosting local tourism. The decision was made during a council meeting on Tuesday evening, following months of consultations with local residents and businesses.

The £5 million funding will support various projects including improvements to public spaces, installation of new amenities for visitors, and enhancements to coastal defenses to protect against rising sea levels. Council leader Councillor Richard Garton highlighted the importance of this investment in the town’s future: “This is a major step forward for Hastings, ensuring our seafront remains a key attraction while safeguarding it against environmental challenges.”

Local businesses have expressed their support for the initiative, believing it will bring more footfall to the area and stimulate economic growth. However, some residents remain concerned about potential impacts on local flora and fauna, raising questions about the project’s sustainability.

The council has promised further engagement with all stakeholders as the projects progress, ensuring that any concerns are addressed thoroughly.
