This week, Hastings and Rye have been buzzing with activity as the annual Heritage Week kicked off, celebrating the rich history of both towns. Events include guided tours of historic sites such as St Mary in the Castle church and the Old Town’s medieval buildings.

Festivities also extend to educational workshops aimed at children and adults alike, focusing on traditional crafts like pottery and weaving. The week culminates with a grand community dinner where residents are encouraged to bring their family recipes for a taste of local culinary heritage.

Organisers have expressed their gratitude to the town councils for providing support in making this year's Heritage Week possible. With attendance exceeding expectations, the event has not only promoted cultural awareness but also boosted local tourism.
