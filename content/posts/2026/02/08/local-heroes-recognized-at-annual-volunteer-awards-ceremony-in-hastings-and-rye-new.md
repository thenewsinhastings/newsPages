Last night saw the prestigious annual Volunteer Awards ceremony take place in Hastings Town Hall. The event, which celebrates individuals and groups who have made significant contributions to their local communities through volunteer work, was attended by more than two hundred people from across Hastings and Rye.

The evening included speeches by council members and community leaders praising the dedication of volunteers. Award categories ranged from 'Outstanding Achievement' to 'Newcomer Volunteer of the Year.' Winners were recognized for initiatives such as setting up food banks, supporting local schools, and providing care services for elderly residents.

Mayor of Hastings, Councillor Jane Smith, emphasized the importance of volunteer work in maintaining a strong sense of community. She stated, 'Volunteers are the backbone of our society. They enrich the lives of others through selfless acts, making Hastings and Rye better places to live.'

Among the winners was Rachel Williams from Rye, who received the Outstanding Achievement Award for her pioneering work in environmental conservation projects within the town.

The event concluded with a reception where attendees had the opportunity to mingle and share stories about their volunteer experiences. Local organizers have already started planning next year's ceremony, promising more categories and increased recognition for volunteers.
