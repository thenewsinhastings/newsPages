In a brief but significant meeting held in Ft. Mitchell under the leadership of newly elected Mayor Greg Pohlgeers, the council went into executive session to discuss two applications submitted for filling the vacancy created by Pohlgeers' departure from his previous position. The meeting took place shortly after it was called to order, indicating a swift transition as the town navigates this political shift.

Residents of Hastings and Rye will be interested in how this decision impacts their local community and governance structures moving forward.
