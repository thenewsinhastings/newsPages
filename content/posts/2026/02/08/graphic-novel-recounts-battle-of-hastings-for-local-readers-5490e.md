A new graphic novel has been released in the area to bring the historic Battle of Hastings to life for local readers. The publication aims to make this pivotal moment in English history more accessible and engaging, particularly for younger audiences.

The book delves into the events surrounding the Norman invasion of England in 1066, a period that holds significant importance for residents of Hastings and Rye due to their close historical ties to the battle. Local historians and educators have praised the novel's ability to capture both the drama and complexity of this transformative event.

'With its vivid illustrations and compelling narrative, the graphic novel offers an innovative way for our community to connect with a crucial part of our heritage,' commented Dr. Emma Bennett, a local history professor at the University of Sussex, who has been instrumental in promoting the new release within schools and cultural institutions across Hastings and Rye.

The initiative is part of a broader effort to enhance historical education and engagement among locals, reflecting the area's rich tapestry of past events that continue to shape its identity today.
