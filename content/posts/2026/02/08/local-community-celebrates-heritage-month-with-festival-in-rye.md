This month, the vibrant community of Rye comes alive to celebrate its rich heritage through a series of events and activities. The annual Heritage Festival, which kicked off last week, features guided tours of historic buildings, live music performances by local artists, and interactive workshops for all ages.

One of the highlights is an exhibition at the Rye Art Gallery showcasing artefacts from Rye's storied past, including ancient manuscripts and medieval coins. The event not only attracts residents but also draws in visitors from across Sussex who are eager to learn about the town’s rich cultural history.

The festival aims to foster a sense of pride and unity within the community while providing educational value for both locals and tourists alike. Organizers hope that by highlighting Rye's heritage, they can inspire future generations to preserve and celebrate their local history.
