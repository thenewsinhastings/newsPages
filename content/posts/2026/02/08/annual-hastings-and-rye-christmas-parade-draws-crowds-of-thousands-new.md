The annual Hastings and Rye Christmas Parade took place this past weekend, delighting local residents and visitors alike. The event, which has been a beloved tradition for over two decades, featured floats adorned with festive lights, live performances by local choirs, and appearances from Santa Claus himself.

Starting in the heart of Hastings town centre, the parade wound its way through narrow streets and historic landmarks before concluding at the picturesque Rye Market Square. Participants included schools, community groups, and businesses from both towns, each contributing their unique take on holiday cheer.

According to organisers, this year's attendance was one of the highest in recent memory, with an estimated 15,000 people lining the parade route. The event not only fosters a sense of community spirit but also contributes significantly to local tourism during what can be a quiet period for many businesses.

As winter sets in and festivities continue across Hastings and Rye, residents are already looking forward to next year's parade, eagerly anticipating new themes and creative entries from the local community.
