The Hastings Borough Council has approved significant funding to enhance coastal defenses in response to increasing sea levels and storm threats. The project, which will see improvements to existing structures along the coast as well as new installations designed to protect against flooding and erosion, is expected to begin construction early next year.

At a recent council meeting, Councillor Jane Smith highlighted the importance of this initiative for local residents, emphasizing the need for robust measures in light of recent extreme weather events that have impacted the area. The funding will also support ongoing maintenance and monitoring efforts to ensure the long-term sustainability of coastal defenses.

Local environmental groups have welcomed the decision, praising the council's commitment to protecting both the natural environment and the local economy from potential damage caused by climate change. However, some residents are concerned about the potential disruption during construction phases and the impact on local businesses in affected areas.

The project is part of a wider strategy aimed at adapting Hastings to future environmental challenges while preserving its unique character and heritage.
