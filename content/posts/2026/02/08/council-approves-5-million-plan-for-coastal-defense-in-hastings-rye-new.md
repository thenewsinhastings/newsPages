The Hastings and Rye Council has unanimously approved a major investment plan of £5 million to strengthen coastal defenses against rising sea levels. The initiative, which will be rolled out over the next three years, aims to protect both communities from severe flooding events anticipated due to climate change.

Council leader Jane Thompson emphasized that this project is crucial for safeguarding local residents and businesses from potential disaster. 'Our priority is ensuring that Hastings and Rye remain safe havens for our community,' she stated during a council meeting last week.

The funding will support the construction of new sea walls, reinforcement of existing defenses, and the installation of state-of-the-art monitoring systems to track water levels in real-time. Local residents have expressed their appreciation for these measures, which they see as vital for maintaining the area's heritage and economy.

Environmental campaigners also welcomed the decision, praising the council’s proactive stance on climate adaptation. However, some business owners remain concerned about the immediate economic impact of construction works during peak tourism seasons.

As the project moves forward, community engagement will be a key focus to address any concerns and ensure that local needs are met effectively.
