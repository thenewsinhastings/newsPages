In a bid to enhance economic growth in Hastings, the local council has announced several initiatives aimed at supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) within the region. The proposals include reduced business rates for start-ups, enhanced support services for new entrepreneurs, and a dedicated fund to aid businesses affected by recent economic challenges.

Councillor Sarah Evans, leader of the council's economic development committee, stated during an interview with our paper that these measures are designed to create a more supportive environment for local companies. 'We believe that by reducing financial barriers and providing additional resources, we can encourage innovation and job creation within Hastings,' said Councillor Evans.

The council will be hosting public consultations in the coming weeks to gather feedback from residents and business owners on these proposed initiatives. Details of upcoming meetings will be announced through local media channels and community boards.

For further information about the economic development plans, interested parties are encouraged to visit the Hastings Council website or contact their local councillor.
