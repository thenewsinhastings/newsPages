HASTINGS – Local charities came together this weekend to celebrate the success of a fundraising event held at the White Rock Leisure Centre. The event, which was organised by Hastings and Rye Community Support Network (HRCSN), attracted hundreds of local residents who generously supported the various initiatives on offer.

The event featured a range of activities including live music performances, silent auctions, and a children’s fun fair area. Local businesses also contributed significantly to the success of the event by providing goods and services for auction as well as offering raffle prizes.

Among the beneficiaries of this year’s fundraising efforts were local food banks, homeless shelters, and youth support programs that serve Hastings and Rye. The HRCSN reported that they have already exceeded their initial target, raising over £10,000 in just a few hours.

“We are thrilled with the community response,” said Jane Thompson, Chair of HRCSN. “It’s heartening to see how many people come together to support those less fortunate within our town.”

Proceeds from the event will be distributed equally among all participating charities to help fund their critical work in the area.
