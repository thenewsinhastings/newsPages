The Hastings & Rye Borough Council has approved a new budget proposal aimed at enhancing coastal protection measures along the vulnerable shoreline of both towns. The plan includes significant investments in sea walls, beach replenishment projects, and improved stormwater management systems to mitigate the effects of climate change.

During Monday's council meeting, councillors debated the financial implications of the proposals and their potential long-term benefits for local residents. Councillor John Green, leader of the Liberal Democrats, highlighted the importance of securing further government funding to support such ambitious projects, stating that 'the future resilience of our coastal communities hinges on decisive action now.'

The budget proposal also allocates funds towards community engagement initiatives, encouraging residents and stakeholders to participate in decision-making processes related to environmental protection. This move is seen as a positive step towards building stronger ties between the council and its constituents.

Environmental activists from the Hastings Climate Action Group have expressed cautious optimism about the proposed measures but urge for more stringent regulations on coastal development and increased public awareness campaigns.

The approved budget will be subject to review by the Department of Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) before final implementation. Residents are encouraged to stay informed through upcoming community meetings scheduled throughout April.
