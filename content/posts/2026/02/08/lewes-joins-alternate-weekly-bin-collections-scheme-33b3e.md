Residents of Lewes are set to experience a new approach to waste management as the town adopts an alternate weekly bin collection scheme. The initiative, designed to promote recycling and manage non-recyclable waste more effectively, will see recyclables collected in one week while non-recyclable waste is picked up the following week.

This change comes as part of broader efforts by local authorities to enhance environmental sustainability within the Hastings & Rye region. Lewes joins a growing list of towns across East Sussex implementing similar schemes aimed at reducing landfill waste and encouraging community participation in recycling initiatives.

Details regarding the schedule for these collections, along with information on what items can be recycled, will soon be made available through the local council’s website and social media channels. Local residents are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the new system to ensure smooth transitions and continued compliance with waste management regulations.
