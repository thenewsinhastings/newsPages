The council meeting on Tuesday saw the approval of a new budget aimed at bolstering coastal defences in Hastings and Rye. The proposal, which includes £2 million for urgent repairs and upgrades to sea walls and flood barriers, was met with general support from councillors.

This investment comes as part of an ongoing effort to protect local communities against rising sea levels and increased storm activity due to climate change. Mayor Jane Smith highlighted the importance of these measures in her opening address, stating that “the safety of our residents is paramount.”

Local resident groups have been vocal about the necessity for such improvements, with several petitions circulating recently demanding immediate action on coastal resilience. Councillor Tom Williams from the Green Party noted during the meeting that there should be a focus not only on hard engineering solutions but also on natural coastal management techniques to ensure long-term sustainability.

The budget will now go through further scrutiny before being finalised in the coming weeks. Community members are encouraged to stay informed and participate in upcoming consultations scheduled for the spring.
