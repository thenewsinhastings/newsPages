The Hastings Borough Council has given the green light to a new waste management plan aimed at improving recycling rates and reducing environmental impact in both Hastings and Rye. The initiative, which was debated extensively during this month's council meeting, includes measures such as increased recycling bins across public areas, enhanced collection services for organic waste, and educational programs targeting schools and businesses.

Councillor Jane Smith, the lead spokesperson on environment issues, stated that 'This plan is a significant step towards our goal of becoming more sustainable communities. We are committed to working closely with residents and local businesses to ensure a smooth transition and effective implementation.'

The plan also highlights the council's intention to explore partnerships with waste management companies to implement innovative solutions for reducing landfill use and promoting circular economy practices.

Local activists and environmental groups have welcomed the move, expressing hope that it will contribute positively towards addressing long-standing issues such as littering and ineffective recycling systems in both towns. However, some concerns were raised regarding the potential costs and whether funding is sufficient to support all aspects of the new plan.

Residents interested in learning more about how they can participate or provide feedback on this initiative are encouraged to visit the council's official website or attend upcoming public consultations.
