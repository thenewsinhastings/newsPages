The Hastings and Rye neighbourhoods have seen a significant boost in community safety over the past five years, thanks to the efforts of local volunteers in the Neighbourhood Watch scheme. Since its inception, this initiative has grown from just a handful of participants to more than 20 active groups across both towns, covering a wide range of areas.

Volunteers meet regularly with police officers and community leaders to discuss local issues and identify potential risks. The scheme not only helps in reducing crime but also fosters a sense of unity among residents, encouraging neighbours to look out for one another.

At a recent gathering to mark the anniversary, Chief Inspector Jane Thompson praised the volunteers for their dedication and commitment. She highlighted several successful operations where vigilant watchers have helped prevent break-ins or other criminal activities by reporting suspicious behaviour promptly.

Local councillor Peter Green expressed his gratitude towards all those involved in this vital community service: “The Neighbourhood Watch scheme exemplifies what can be achieved when communities come together for the betterment of their neighbourhoods. We are incredibly proud to support such an impactful project.”

As part of its ongoing commitment, the council has pledged additional resources and training sessions throughout the year to help volunteers enhance their skills and effectiveness.

To celebrate the achievement, a special event is being planned for later this month where members will be honoured alongside new recruits joining the initiative. The community is encouraged to participate in upcoming activities and learn how they can contribute towards making Hastings and Rye safer places to live.
