The Hastings Borough Council is set to debate new planning regulations that could significantly impact local development and housing projects in the coming months. The proposed changes aim to balance growth with environmental sustainability, addressing concerns raised by both residents and developers.

At a public consultation held last week, citizens expressed mixed opinions regarding the potential implications of these reforms on local heritage sites and green spaces. Mayor Emily Thompson has assured the community that all feedback will be carefully considered before final decisions are made.

Key points under discussion include stricter guidelines for renewable energy installations in new constructions and enhanced protections for designated conservation areas. The council hopes to finalize the revised planning policies by early next year, pending approval from East Sussex County Council.
