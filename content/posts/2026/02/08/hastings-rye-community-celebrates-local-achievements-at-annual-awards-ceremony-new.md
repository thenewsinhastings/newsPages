The annual Hastings and Rye Community Awards ceremony took place last night at the Town Hall, celebrating local heroes who have made significant contributions to their communities throughout the year. A wide range of categories were recognized, including Volunteer of the Year, Environmental Champion, and Unsung Hero.

Among this year's winners was John Smith from St Leonards-on-Sea, who received the Environmental Champion award for his tireless efforts in organizing beach clean-ups and raising awareness about marine conservation issues. Another notable recipient was Sarah Lee from Rye, honored as Volunteer of the Year for her work with the local food bank.

The event was attended by members of both the Hastings and Rye town councils, who praised the recipients' dedication to making a positive impact in their respective areas. Mayor of Hastings, Councillor Jane Evans, commended all nominees for their outstanding commitment to community service.
