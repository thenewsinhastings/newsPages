In a closely watched meeting at the Hastings Town Hall, councillors approved the town's new budget for the fiscal year ahead. The decision comes after weeks of public consultations and heated debates about funding priorities, particularly regarding environmental projects and community services.

Mayor Emma Taylor emphasised that the council has prioritised investments in renewable energy initiatives and improvements to local parks. However, some residents have expressed concern over potential cuts to youth programs and library facilities.

The budget proposal was presented by Deputy Mayor Richard Green, who stressed the importance of balancing financial responsibilities with community needs. He acknowledged the challenges posed by rising operational costs but reassured stakeholders that every effort has been made to maintain essential services.

During the meeting, several councillors highlighted their commitment to transparency and encouraged further dialogue between residents and council members to address any remaining concerns.

This decision marks a significant step in shaping Hastings' economic direction for the upcoming year. As the budget takes effect, stakeholders will be looking closely at how funds are allocated and whether initial promises are met.
