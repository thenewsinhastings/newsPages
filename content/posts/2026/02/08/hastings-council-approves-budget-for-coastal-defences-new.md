The Hastings Borough Council has approved a significant budget allocation aimed at strengthening coastal defences in the face of rising sea levels and increasing storm frequency. The move, which was met with broad support among councillors, is seen as a crucial step towards safeguarding the town's historic landmarks and residential areas from potential flooding.

At the council meeting last night, Councillor Jane Thompson presented the proposed budget, outlining plans to install new flood barriers along the promenade and enhance existing sea walls. The initiative also includes a community outreach programme aimed at educating residents about flood risks and preparedness measures.

Mayor David Mitchell praised the proactive approach of his colleagues, stating, 'This is an investment in our future. Protecting our coastline isn't just about bricks and mortar; it's about securing the livelihoods and well-being of every resident.'

Opposition leader Tony James acknowledged the necessity of the project but called for greater transparency on how the funds will be spent and a commitment to regular audits to ensure accountability.

Local environmental groups have welcomed the decision, noting that while it addresses immediate threats, there remains a need for broader regional cooperation to tackle climate change impacts comprehensively.
