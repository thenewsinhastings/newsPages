Residents of Hastings and Rye came together on a sunny Saturday morning to participate in the annual charity run, raising funds for local children's hospitals. Over three hundred runners took part in the event which saw participants of all ages, from young families with prams to seasoned athletes, making their way through picturesque streets.

The race started at the heart of Hastings' Old Town and concluded at the scenic Rye Harbour Nature Reserve, where a celebratory picnic was held. Local businesses also contributed by setting up stalls along the route offering refreshments and souvenirs for participants and spectators alike.

Organisers praised the community spirit shown during the event, highlighting that it not only raises money but also fosters connections among residents from both towns. Proceeds from this year's run will be donated to the local children's hospital, aiding in essential medical equipment and services.
