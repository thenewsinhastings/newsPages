The Hastings Borough Council has approved a new plan to increase affordable housing in the region. The initiative aims to address the ongoing shortage of affordable homes by allocating additional funding towards social housing projects and setting targets for developers to include affordable units in their schemes.

Councillor Jane Roberts, leader of the Labour group on Hastings Borough Council, praised the decision, stating, “This plan marks a significant step forward in our efforts to ensure that residents from all walks of life can find homes they can afford.”

The Conservative-led administration countered by highlighting the need for more private sector investment alongside council measures. Councillor Mark Thompson argued, “While we welcome this initiative, it is crucial that we also encourage and incentivise developers to contribute towards affordable housing solutions.”

Local residents have expressed a mix of optimism and concern over the plans. Sarah Lee, a long-term resident of Rye, said, “It’s about time something like this was put in place. I hope it will help young families who are struggling to find homes within their budget.” However, concerns remain about whether the measures will be sufficient given the scale of the housing crisis.

The council plans to monitor progress closely and has promised regular updates on how the new scheme is progressing and its impact on local communities.
