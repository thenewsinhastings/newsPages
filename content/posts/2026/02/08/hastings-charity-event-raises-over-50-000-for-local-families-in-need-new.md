A heartwarming community event held in Hastings this weekend has seen local families come together to raise over £50,000 for those most in need. The annual charity ball, organised by the Hastings Community Foundation, was attended by hundreds of residents and local business owners who generously supported the cause with their donations.

The funds raised will be used to provide essential services such as food vouchers, winter clothing, and educational resources for families facing financial difficulties across the district. Speaking at the event, Fiona Wright, Chairperson of Hastings Community Foundation, expressed her gratitude towards all those involved in making this year's fundraiser a success.

'The support we receive from our local community is truly remarkable,' Ms. Wright said. 'With these funds, we can make a real difference to the lives of many families struggling with rising costs.'

The charity ball featured live music performances, raffles, and auctions which contributed significantly to the fundraising efforts. Organisers also highlighted the importance of such events in fostering community spirit and unity among residents.
