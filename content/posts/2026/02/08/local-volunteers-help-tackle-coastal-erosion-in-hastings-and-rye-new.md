HASTINGS & RYE, UK - Local volunteers have been stepping up efforts to combat coastal erosion along the shores of Hastings and Rye. This ongoing initiative aims to protect both communities from the increasing threats posed by rising sea levels and storm surges.

Working alongside local council officials and environmental agencies, the volunteers have installed several rock barriers and sandbags at key points along the coastline. These measures are designed not only to provide immediate protection but also to encourage more natural methods of coastal stabilization over time.

Speaking about the project, Sarah Thompson, a volunteer coordinator from Rye, said: 'It's fantastic to see so many people coming together to help protect our homes and businesses. Every little bit counts, and we hope that by working collaboratively with local authorities, we can make a real difference.'

Residents are encouraged to participate in upcoming community clean-up days scheduled for this month. These events will also serve as awareness sessions on how individuals can contribute towards long-term environmental conservation.
