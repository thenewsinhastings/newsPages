The Hastings Borough Council is scheduled to hold a crucial debate on new planning regulations that could significantly impact development within the Hastings and Rye area. The proposed changes aim to balance residential growth with environmental conservation, addressing concerns over traffic congestion, housing shortages, and green space preservation.

Residents are encouraged to participate in upcoming public consultations as part of the council's commitment to transparency and community engagement. Local businesses have also been invited to share their insights during a series of roundtable discussions scheduled for early next month.

Key stakeholders from both Hastings and Rye will present their views on how the new regulations might affect local development, economic growth, and quality of life. The council has assured that all perspectives will be considered as it finalizes the proposed changes to ensure they are fair and beneficial for the entire community.
