In response to the increasing need for food assistance in the Hastings area this winter, local charity 'Hope and Help' has launched a new food bank. The initiative aims to provide essential supplies to those facing financial difficulties due to rising costs of living.

The food bank will be open on Wednesdays from 2pm to 6pm at the town hall community center in Hastings, offering groceries and non-perishable items. 'Hope and Help' encourages donations from local businesses and residents to ensure a continuous supply for those who need it most.

According to the charity's spokesperson, the demand for emergency food parcels has risen significantly over recent months, prompting the urgent action to establish a more sustainable system to support struggling families and individuals in the Hastings & Rye area.
