A new bar in Brighton has opened its doors as a dedicated space for women’s sports, marking what is believed to be the first of its kind in the UK. Crossbar Brighton aims to cater specifically to female sporting fans, offering a platform where they can gather and celebrate their favourite teams and athletes. The venue will screen top-tier women's competitions from around the world, including football, basketball, rugby, and more.

While Crossbar Brighton is primarily focused on women’s sports, it also caters to those interested in men's sport, ensuring a versatile atmosphere that welcomes all genders. This initiative is seen as a step towards gender equality in sports coverage and engagement within the community.

The opening of this unique establishment has garnered significant local interest, with residents from nearby Hastings and Rye looking forward to its potential impact on regional sporting culture. It promises to offer a fresh perspective on how communities can support and celebrate women’s sports.
