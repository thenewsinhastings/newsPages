The Hastings and Rye Council has proposed a new budget aimed at boosting the local economy and enhancing community services. The proposal includes an increase in funding for small businesses, infrastructure improvements, and additional resources for social care.

During a public council meeting last week, councillors discussed plans to allocate more funds towards supporting local enterprises affected by recent economic challenges. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to revitalise the region's economy and create job opportunities.

Residents are encouraged to participate in upcoming consultation sessions where they can provide feedback on the proposed budget changes. The council aims to ensure that every community member has an opportunity to voice their opinions and contribute to shaping the future of Hastings and Rye.
