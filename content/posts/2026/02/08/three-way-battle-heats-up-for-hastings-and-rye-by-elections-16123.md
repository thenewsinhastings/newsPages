The political landscape in Hastings and Rye is heating up with a three-way battle shaping up for the upcoming by-election. Labour faces tough competition from both the Greens, who are currently favoured by bookmakers, and Reform Party, hoping to capitalise on any split vote among left-leaning voters.

With Labour's current majority standing at 13,000 votes, local political experts warn that this election could be a 'pollster’s nightmare' due to its unpredictable nature. The Reform Party sees an opportunity in the divided sentiment of traditionally progressive constituencies and aims to disrupt the status quo.

Local residents are urged to pay close attention as this race tightens, with each party making their final appeals before polling day.
