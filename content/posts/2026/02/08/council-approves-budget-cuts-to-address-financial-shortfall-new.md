The Hastings and Rye Borough Council has approved a series of budget cuts aimed at addressing a significant financial shortfall for the upcoming fiscal year. The council meeting, which saw extensive debate among members, concluded with a vote to reduce funding in several departments including leisure services, community development, and environmental programs.

Councillor Jane Thompson highlighted that these measures are necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of public services within Hastings and Rye. She emphasized that while the cuts are painful for residents, they are essential given the current economic climate and the need to maintain core service provision without incurring further debt.

Opposition councillors have criticized the decision, arguing that alternative funding sources should be explored before reducing essential community programs. They pointed out the potential impact on local communities reliant on these services for youth activities, environmental protection, and cultural events.

The council's finance committee will now work closely with department heads to implement the new budget structure effectively from April 2024 onwards. Residents are encouraged to engage with their local councillors to discuss any concerns or suggestions regarding the changes.
