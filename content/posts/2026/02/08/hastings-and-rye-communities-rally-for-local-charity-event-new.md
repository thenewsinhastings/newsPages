Residents of Hastings and Rye have come together to support a local charity event aimed at raising funds and awareness for the town's vulnerable citizens. The event, organised by the Hastings & Rye Community Support Group (HRCSG), will take place on Saturday at the Rye Arts Centre.

The initiative aims to bring the community closer through various activities including a fun run, bake sale, and live music performances. Local businesses have also pledged their support with discounts and donations, ensuring that proceeds go directly towards improving the quality of life for those in need within Hastings and Rye.

“With your help, we can make a real difference,” says Jane Davies, Chairperson of HRCSG. “We hope to encourage more people to get involved and contribute positively to our community.”

For those interested in participating or making a donation, further details are available on the HRCSG website.
