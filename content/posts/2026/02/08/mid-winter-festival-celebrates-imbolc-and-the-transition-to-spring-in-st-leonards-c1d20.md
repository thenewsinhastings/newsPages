Last weekend saw St Leonards come alive with music and festivities as Sounds St Leonards hosted the Mid-Winter Festival, a celebration that marked the ancient Celtic festival of Imbolc. This traditional event honours the movement from winter into spring, offering residents and visitors alike an opportunity to embrace the warmth of community spirit amidst the chill of January.

Imbolc, also known as Saint Brigid’s Day in Christian tradition, is celebrated on February 1st but the festival was extended over a weekend to allow more people to enjoy the cultural significance and joyous atmosphere. With performances ranging from folk music to contemporary artists, the event highlighted local talent while welcoming acts from further afield.

The highlight of the festival was a spectacular fire ceremony in Jubilee Square on Saturday evening. This symbolic act represents the purifying and renewing properties associated with Imbolc, as well as the anticipation of spring’s arrival after winter's long spell.

Commenting on the event, festival organiser Jane Smith said: 'It has been incredible to see how people from all walks of life have come together for this celebration. The Mid-Winter Festival not only enriches our cultural landscape but also strengthens our sense of community.'

As Hastings & Rye continue their recovery and development post-pandemic, events like the Mid-Winter Festival play a crucial role in fostering local pride and unity.
