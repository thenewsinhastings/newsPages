Local artist JJ Waller’s latest exhibition has captivated visitors to Hastings Museum this week. The show, which features a collection of vibrant landscapes and seascapes, has been well-received by both locals and tourists alike.

Waller, who is known for his detailed renderings of the Hastings coastline, says he was inspired by recent visits to various coastal towns in East Sussex. Speaking at the opening event on Tuesday evening, Waller shared insights into his creative process and expressed gratitude towards the museum staff for their support throughout the planning stages.

The exhibition will run until early November, offering art enthusiasts an opportunity to explore the rich cultural heritage of Hastings through Waller's unique perspective.
