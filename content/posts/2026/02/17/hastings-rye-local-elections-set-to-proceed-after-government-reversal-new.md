In a significant turn of events, Hastings and Rye's local elections will now proceed as originally planned following the government's decision to reverse its earlier directive. The move follows weeks of uncertainty for both residents and candidates who were concerned about potential delays or cancellations due to recent changes in national policy.

The decision has been welcomed by local councillors and community leaders, who argue that holding these elections is crucial for ensuring democratic representation at the grassroots level. It also marks a return to normalcy for many who had expressed concerns over the logistical challenges of postponing such an important civic event.

James Ryder, Political Editor, highlights: 'This change in stance from the government underscores the importance of local decision-making and the need to maintain trust within our democratic processes.' As election day approaches, all eyes are on Hastings and Rye as voters prepare to cast their ballots for those who will represent them over the next four years.
