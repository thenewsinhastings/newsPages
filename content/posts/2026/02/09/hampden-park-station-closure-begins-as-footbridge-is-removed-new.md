The Hampden Park railway station has temporarily closed its doors to the public as part of a significant infrastructure upgrade project. The current phase involves the removal and replacement of the footbridge, which connects the two sides of the rail network at the station.

Due to this closure, passengers traveling between Polegate, Eastbourne, and Hastings are advised to use replacement buses for their journeys. The disruption is expected to last several weeks while the necessary work is carried out.

Local residents have been informed through various channels including community noticeboards, social media updates, and direct mailings to keep them informed of the planned works and to provide alternative travel arrangements during this period.
