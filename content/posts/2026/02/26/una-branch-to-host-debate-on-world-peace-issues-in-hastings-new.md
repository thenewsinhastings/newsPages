The United Nations Association (UNA) branch in Hastings is set to host an important debate focusing on the pressing issues currently undermining world peace. This event, scheduled for next week, will bring together local residents and community leaders to discuss topics such as international conflicts, climate change, and human rights violations.

Organisers hope that by raising awareness of these critical global challenges, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of their impact on our daily lives and explore potential solutions. The debate aims to foster dialogue and encourage active engagement from the public in addressing these complex issues.

For those interested in participating or learning more about upcoming events, the UNA Hastings branch encourages individuals to visit their local meeting place or join them online for updates.
