The local branch of the United Nations Association (UNA) is set to host a significant debate this weekend, focusing on some of the most pressing issues that threaten world peace. The event, which will take place at the Hastings Town Hall, invites members and guests from across the region to discuss topics such as climate change, international conflicts, and economic disparities.

The UNA Hastings branch has organised previous successful meetings around global affairs but this debate promises to be particularly engaging due to its focus on current challenges. As part of their ongoing mission to promote understanding and cooperation among nations, the organisation encourages local residents with an interest in these matters to attend and contribute to the discussion.

For more information or to register for the event, interested individuals can contact the UNA Hastings branch through their official website or social media platforms.
