The Hastings and Rye branch of the United Nations Association (UNA) is set to host a significant debate this week, focusing on key challenges currently undermining world peace. The event promises to bring together local community members, politicians, and experts for an engaging discussion.

Topics up for debate include international conflicts, climate change impacts, economic inequalities, and the role of technology in fostering global stability. Local residents are encouraged to attend and participate in what is expected to be a thought-provoking conversation on how individuals can contribute to peace initiatives at a local level.
