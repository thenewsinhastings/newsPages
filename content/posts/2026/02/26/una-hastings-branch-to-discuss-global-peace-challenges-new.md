The United Nations Association (UNA) branch in Hastings is set to host a debate on pressing issues that undermine world peace. The meeting, which will take place at the local library this Saturday evening, aims to raise awareness about global challenges and encourage community members to engage with international affairs.

Topics for discussion include conflicts around the globe, climate change, economic disparities, and the role of diplomacy in resolving disputes between nations. The event is open to everyone interested in contributing to a more peaceful world.

For those unable to attend, the UNA Hastings branch will be live-streaming the debate on their official website. Details for accessing the stream can be found on their social media pages.
