The United Nations Association (UNA) branch in Hastings is set to hold a significant debate focusing on the pressing issues that continue to undermine world peace. The event, scheduled for this Friday at the local library, will bring together community members and experts to explore the complexities of global conflicts and discuss potential solutions.

Attendees are invited to engage in an open dialogue about topics such as international relations, human rights violations, and economic disparities, all of which contribute to instability on a worldwide scale. The aim is to raise awareness among local residents about these critical issues while encouraging informed discussions that can lead to positive change both locally and globally.

For those interested in participating or learning more about the UNA’s mission to promote peace and understanding across nations, the event promises to be an enlightening experience.
