The local branch of the United Nations Association (UNA) is set to host a debate focusing on critical issues that are currently undermining world peace. The event, scheduled for next week at the Hastings Town Hall, aims to bring together community members and experts to discuss pressing global challenges affecting security, stability, and cooperation among nations.

Topics expected to be covered include international conflicts, climate change impacts on geopolitical relations, economic disparities between developed and developing countries, and the role of digital communication in fostering or hindering peace. Attendees will have the opportunity to engage with speakers and contribute their own insights towards finding solutions for these complex issues.

The UNA branch encourages all interested individuals who wish to understand more about global politics and its effects on local communities to attend this informative debate.
