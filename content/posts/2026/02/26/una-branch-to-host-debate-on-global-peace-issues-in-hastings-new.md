The local branch of the United Nations Association (UNA) is set to host a debate this week focusing on pressing issues that undermine world peace. The event, open to all members and interested residents, aims to foster discussion around topics such as international conflicts, climate change, human rights abuses, and economic instability.

Scheduled for Wednesday evening at the Hastings Town Hall, attendees will have an opportunity to engage with local experts and community leaders in a roundtable format designed to encourage dialogue and explore potential solutions. The UNA branch hopes that this event will not only raise awareness but also inspire action towards achieving a more peaceful world.

For those interested in participating or learning more about the United Nations Association, further details can be found on their website or by contacting local organizers.
