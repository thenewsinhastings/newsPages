The United Nations Association (UNA) branch in Hastings is set to host a debate focusing on the pressing issues that are currently undermining world peace. The event aims to bring together local residents, students, and experts for an engaging discussion about global challenges such as climate change, conflict resolution, and human rights abuses.

Scheduled to take place at the Civic Centre next Wednesday evening, the meeting will feature keynote speakers from various backgrounds who have dedicated their careers to promoting peace and security worldwide. Attendees are encouraged to participate in panel discussions and Q&A sessions to gain a deeper understanding of these critical global issues and explore ways in which they can contribute to positive change within their communities.
