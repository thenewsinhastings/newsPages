The Hastings and Rye branch of the United Nations Association (UNA) will host a public debate on Thursday evening, focusing on the pressing issues that continue to undermine world peace. The event is aimed at fostering community engagement with global affairs and encouraging local perspectives on international challenges.

Participants are expected to discuss topics ranging from climate change and political instability to economic inequality and human rights violations. Local members of the UNA have invited all interested individuals, regardless of background or expertise level, to join in the dialogue about these critical issues affecting our interconnected world.

The debate will take place at the Town Hall starting at 6:00 PM and is free to attend for everyone. Refreshments will be provided.
