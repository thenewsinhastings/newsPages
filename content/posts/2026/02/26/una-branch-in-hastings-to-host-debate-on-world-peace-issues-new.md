The United Nations Association (UNA) branch based in Hastings is set to host a significant debate focusing on the pressing issues that are currently undermining global peace and stability. The event, scheduled for next week at the Town Hall, will bring together local experts, community leaders, and engaged citizens to discuss topics ranging from conflict resolution and international diplomacy to human rights and environmental protection.

Speakers include representatives from local schools, charities, and businesses who will share their insights on how these global issues impact our community. The aim of this event is not only to raise awareness but also to encourage proactive steps towards fostering peace both locally and globally. Attendees are invited to contribute their thoughts and ideas during the discussion sessions.

This initiative aligns with UNA's mission to promote international cooperation and understanding, making it a perfect platform for Hastings residents to engage in meaningful dialogue about world affairs. For more information or to register your attendance, visit the official UNA branch website.
