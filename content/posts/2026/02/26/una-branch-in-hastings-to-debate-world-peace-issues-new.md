The United Nations Association (UNA) branch in Hastings is set to hold a debate on the pressing issues that are undermining world peace. This discussion will take place at the local community centre, aiming to raise awareness and encourage dialogue among residents about global challenges affecting stability and harmony around the globe.

Members of the UNA and guests from various backgrounds are expected to participate in this event, sharing insights on topics such as international conflicts, human rights violations, and environmental crises that contribute to a less peaceful world. The debate is an opportunity for Hastings' community members to engage with these critical issues and consider how local actions can have global impacts.

For those interested in participating or learning more about the UNA's mission of promoting peace and understanding across nations, the event promises to be both enlightening and thought-provoking.
