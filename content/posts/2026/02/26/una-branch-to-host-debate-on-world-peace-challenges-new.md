The local branch of the United Nations Association (UNA) is set to host a debate at the Hastings Town Hall next week, focusing on key issues that threaten global peace and stability. The event will bring together community leaders, activists, and interested members of the public to discuss pressing concerns such as climate change, geopolitical tensions, and economic disparities.

The aim of this gathering is to raise awareness about these challenges and explore possible ways to address them at a local level, with the understanding that small actions can contribute to global peace efforts. The debate promises to be an informative and engaging event for all those interested in making a positive impact on our world.
