The Hastings Borough Council has announced the commencement of a public consultation period on the Draft Local Plan, offering residents and stakeholders an opportunity to share their views and suggestions. The plan aims to guide future development within the borough over the next two decades.

Residents are encouraged to review the draft document and provide feedback via various channels provided by the council. This includes attending virtual meetings, submitting written responses, or participating in online surveys. The consultation period is a critical phase for ensuring that the final Local Plan reflects the needs and aspirations of the community.

The Draft Local Plan outlines proposals for housing, employment, infrastructure, and environmental sustainability. It seeks to balance growth with protection of green spaces and historic areas, as well as addressing issues such as transportation and social amenities.

Council Leader Jane Thompson stated, 'This is a vital moment in shaping Hastings' future. We want every voice from our community to be heard during this process.'
