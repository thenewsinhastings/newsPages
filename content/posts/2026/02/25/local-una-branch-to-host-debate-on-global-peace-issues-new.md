The Hastings branch of the United Nations Association (UNA) is set to host an engaging debate focused on critical issues undermining world peace. The event, scheduled for next week at the town hall, aims to bring together local citizens and experts to discuss pressing global challenges such as climate change, geopolitical conflicts, and human rights violations.

Attendees will have the opportunity to voice their opinions and engage in thoughtful discussions that could influence local perspectives on international affairs. The UNA branch encourages all members of the community who are interested in contributing to a more peaceful world to participate in this important dialogue.
