The local branch of the United Nations Association (UNA) in Hastings is set to host a debate focusing on critical issues undermining world peace. This event, scheduled for next week at the town hall, will bring together community members and experts from various backgrounds to discuss topics such as global conflicts, human rights violations, and environmental threats.

The UNA branch aims to raise awareness about these pressing issues and encourage local participation in international affairs. Attendees are invited to engage in discussions and share their perspectives on how the global community can work towards a more peaceful future.

For those interested in attending or participating in this important dialogue, further details including registration information will be available soon at the Hastings UNA branch website.
