The United Nations Association (UNA) branch in Hastings is set to host a thought-provoking debate that will explore the key challenges currently undermining world peace. The event, scheduled for next week at the Town Hall, promises to be an insightful discussion involving local and international perspectives on security threats, economic instability, climate change impacts, and human rights abuses.

Speakers from various backgrounds, including political figures, academics, community leaders, and activists will gather to discuss how these issues are interconnected and what can be done locally and globally to address them effectively. The debate is open to the public and aims to foster a greater understanding of the complexities involved in maintaining world peace.
