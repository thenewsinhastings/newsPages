Local historians and enthusiasts gathered this week to discuss the intricate planning that may have led to Duke William’s victory at the historic Battle of Hastings, which took place just miles from our coastal towns. The debate focused on whether a carefully orchestrated plan or sheer chance determined the outcome of the pivotal Norman invasion in 1066.

Speakers highlighted several key aspects of the battle, including the role of terrain and weather conditions that could have influenced William's military decisions. Some theories proposed that the Duke's knowledge of local geography played a significant part in his strategic advantage over King Harold’s forces.

Attendees also engaged in discussions about medieval warfare tactics and how they were applied to the Battle of Hastings. The event provided an engaging platform for both experts and amateurs interested in the rich history of our region.
