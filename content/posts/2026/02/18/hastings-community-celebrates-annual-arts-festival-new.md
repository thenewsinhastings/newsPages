The annual Hastings Arts Festival drew a large crowd to the town centre last weekend. With a diverse range of activities including art exhibitions, live music performances, and street food stalls, the festival showcased the vibrant cultural scene in Hastings.

Local artists and performers from across the region contributed to the success of the event, which aimed to highlight the importance of arts in fostering community engagement and creativity. The festival also featured workshops for children and adults alike, encouraging participation and interaction among visitors.

Councillor Jane Smith, who attended the opening ceremony on Saturday morning, praised the organisers for their dedication to promoting local talent and cultural heritage. 'Events like this bring our community together and remind us of the rich artistic traditions we have here in Hastings,' she said.

As the sun set over the festival grounds, attendees enjoyed a spectacular firework display that concluded another successful year of celebrating arts and culture in Hastings.
