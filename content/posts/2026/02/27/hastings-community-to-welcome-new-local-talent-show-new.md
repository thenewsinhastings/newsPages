Hastings is set to become the heart of local entertainment with the launch of a new talent show, 'Running for HOT', aimed at showcasing the city's hidden stars. The initiative, organized by Hastings Online Times (HOT), will offer residents an opportunity to shine on stage and gain recognition within their community.

The event promises a variety of categories, from singing and dancing to spoken word performances, providing participants with a platform to express themselves creatively. Local businesses have already shown interest in sponsoring the event, highlighting the strong support for cultural activities in Hastings.

Registration is now open for interested performers, and the organizers are encouraging all members of the community to participate or come along to cheer on their fellow locals. More details about the competition rules and how to register can be found on the HOT website.
