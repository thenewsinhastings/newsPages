The United Nations Association (UNA) branch in Hastings is set to host an important debate on the key challenges that are currently undermining world peace. The event, which will take place at the Town Hall on Thursday evening, aims to raise awareness and encourage open dialogue among local community members.

Topics up for discussion include global conflicts, climate change impacts, economic disparities, and human rights violations around the globe. Attendees will have the opportunity to engage with experts from various backgrounds who are committed to fostering a more peaceful world through international cooperation and understanding.

The UNA branch encourages all residents of Hastings and Rye interested in contributing to these vital discussions to attend the debate. Refreshments will be served, and there is no need to book in advance.
