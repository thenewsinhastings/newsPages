The annual Hastings Festival is set to return this summer with a wide array of events and activities planned by local groups. The festival, which has been a cornerstone of the community's social calendar for over two decades, aims to bring together residents from across Hastings & Rye to celebrate their rich cultural heritage.

Organizers have announced that this year’s event will include traditional folk music performances, artisanal crafts stalls, and food stands offering local delicacies. Additionally, there will be a children's area with workshops and storytelling sessions designed to engage the younger members of the community.

The festival is supported by various local businesses and volunteers who donate their time and resources to make each year's event more successful than the last. With an estimated 10,000 attendees expected over the weekend, the Hastings Festival continues to be a vibrant showcase of community spirit and local talent.
