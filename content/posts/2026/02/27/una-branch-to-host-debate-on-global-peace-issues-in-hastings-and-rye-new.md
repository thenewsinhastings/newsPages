The United Nations Association (UNA) branch in Hastings and Rye is set to host a significant debate aimed at addressing the critical issues that are currently undermining global peace. The event, which will take place on Saturday, invites community members, political figures, and local experts to engage in an open discussion about the challenges facing world peace today.

Topics of discussion include geopolitical tensions, climate change impacts on international stability, and the role of regional conflicts in exacerbating global instability. Attendees are encouraged to contribute their perspectives and ideas towards fostering a more peaceful planet.

The event is free for all members of the public but requires registration due to limited capacity. For those unable to attend physically, a live stream will be available online, ensuring that anyone interested can participate virtually in this important dialogue about global peace.
