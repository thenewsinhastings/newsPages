The town of Hastings is inviting local artists to submit ideas for enhancing the Bottle Alley area, located along its iconic seafront promenade. The columns in this historic district are set to receive a creative makeover as part of efforts to refresh and rejuvenate the 1930s walkway. Residents and visitors alike are encouraged to contribute their vision for public art that will not only beautify but also tell the story of Hastings’ rich cultural heritage.
