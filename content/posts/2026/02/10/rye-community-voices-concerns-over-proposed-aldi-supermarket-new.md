Local community members have raised objections to plans for a new Aldi supermarket in the heart of Rye, according to sources close to Jempson’s, which currently operates the only large-scale grocery store in the town. The long-standing family-owned business has expressed concerns over the potential impact on local trade and community cohesion.

Residents are divided on the proposal, with some welcoming the prospect of more retail choice and lower prices offered by Aldi. However, others fear that this could harm small independent retailers and disrupt the character of Rye’s historic high street.

The debate comes as discussions about economic development and town planning continue to dominate local conversations in both Hastings and Rye.
